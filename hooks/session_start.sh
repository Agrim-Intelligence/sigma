# flow is a real yes/no conversation and there is nobody there to hold one. The policy-brief block
# further down stays its own separate, pre-existing opt-in feature. Two concerns, kept apart on purpose:
# gating the wizard behind session_start.enabled would silently inherit an unrelated feature's
# off-by-default and never fire for anyone.
# Policy-brief half: OPT-IN. Injects a short SDLC policy brief (+ a doctor-lite install self-check) as
# additionalContext at the start of a session, so Sigma's conventions are in context before the first
# prompt (the UserPromptSubmit gate only fires once the user actually types). Off by default — silent
# unless the repo has a .sdlc/ AND opted in:
#   .sdlc/config.json → {"session_start": {"enabled": true}}
# Advisory only: it never blocks; the self-check warns, never fails. Fail-open everywhere: no python3 /
# no config / not enabled / no .sdlc → emit nothing, exit 0 (a session with no Sigma is untouched).

# #236 / #186: ADOPTED REPOS ONLY. `setup_wizard.wizard_status()` returns "nothing needed" unless
# `.sdlc/config.json` exists and no other plugin owns the directory -- the gate lives in Python, so
# every caller (this hook, the agrim-wizard skill) gets it; a stranger's repo hears nothing, and a
# new repository's entry point is /agrim-init, not this hook.
# Only ONE additionalContext can be emitted per hook invocation, so this block's own exit status
# gates whether the policy-brief block below ever runs at all: exit 0 means "already printed,
# stop here" (caught by the `if`, which `exit 0`s the whole hook immediately, before the
# policy-brief block gets a chance to ALSO print and produce two concatenated JSON blobs on
# stdout); exit 1 -- nothing needed, or the check itself failed -- falls through so the
# policy-brief block runs exactly as it always has. `sys.exit(0)` alone (with no surrounding
# `if`) would only end the python3 subprocess, not this shell script, which is why the `if` here
# is load-bearing and not just style.
#
# HEADLESS SESSIONS SKIP THE WIZARD ENTIRELY. The wizard's whole flow is "ask a real yes/no
# question and act only on yes" -- there is nobody to answer it in a `claude -p /agrim-loop`
# worker, so injecting it there just spends context telling an autonomous run to hold a
# conversation. `SIGMA_RUN_ID` is the signal: skills/agrim-loop/scripts/supervise_daemon.py hands
# it to that subprocess's own `env=` before launching it (its run-id resolution step), and every
# child inherits it. Set -> fall
# through to today's behaviour (silent, or the policy brief if separately enabled).
#
# HONEST LIMIT, DELIBERATELY NOT CLOSED HERE: this reads "a supervised loop is in this process
# tree", which is NOT the same as "no human is watching" -- an interactive session a person
# launched from a shell that happens to carry the variable is skipped too. A proper signal
# (something the launcher sets to mean non-interactive specifically) is real follow-up work, not
# built in this plan. The direction of the error is the safe one: a skipped wizard leaves the user
# in exactly today's status quo, and `/agrim-doctor` still reports everything it would have said.
