## 1.0.0 — the first public release

The first release of the public core: a gated software development lifecycle for coding agents,
run from GitHub issues, with every phase reviewed before the next one starts.

- Seven gated phases for every goal: goal, research, plan, plan review, implement, review and
  retrospective. Each phase writes an artifact the next one reads, and a review verdict is needed
  before any code is edited.
- `/agrim-goal` runs one goal through all seven phases with an approval gate at each boundary, for
  supervised, end-to-end work.
- `/agrim-loop` drains a backlog autonomously: it claims goals, dispatches fresh phase agents, opens
  verified pull requests, and parks or continues each goal until stopped or out of budget.
- Work is tracked where it already lives: GitHub issues, a project board, and the `sdlc:*` label
  model (goal membership, in-progress, blocked, blocking, parked, needs-confirmation).
- `/agrim-doctor` checks the project setup, the dependencies and the host, and prints the fix
  command for anything not ready. `/agrim-init` scaffolds a project's `.sdlc/` layer and
  `/agrim-setup` adopts the kit into an existing repository.
- A local action log records what each goal did; `/agrim-log` reads it back as live status, and
  `/agrim-status` shows the backlog, the current iteration and the review queue.
- One renderer builds every status line, so a single glance names the goal, the phase and what is
  happening right now.
- Host-agnostic by design: the full pipeline is validated on Claude Code, and a Codex adapter runs
  the same skills and scripts there (a complete Codex goal through pull-request merge is still
  unverified). A Cursor adapter ships as experimental, not yet verified in a live Cursor session.
  Lifecycles live in the kit's own Python and in git, never in one host's hooks.
- Safe by default: nothing sends data off the machine, spawns a background process, or consumes
  quota without the operator opting in.
- Released under the MIT licence.
