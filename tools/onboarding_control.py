"""The end-to-end onboarding control (#237): fresh repository -> /agrim-init -> one goal `done`,
in local-goals mode and in github mode, following the README Quickstart TEXT.

WHY. AGENTS.md: "Run the control, or the check is decoration." The Quickstart once shipped in a
state that could not reach `done` (verify.enforce on, verify.command empty) and nothing caught it,
because nothing ran the documented gesture end to end. This script runs it.

WHAT IT READS FROM THE README, AND WHY THAT MATTERS. The commands are PARSED from the README's
`## Quickstart` section and the verify gestures under "What /agrim-init will ask you" -- the init
script path (the Codex/Cursor script-form line), the `/agrim-init` flags (the Claude Code line),
the `verify_detect.py confirm .sdlc <n> <id>` gesture, and the `claude plugin ...` / `codex plugin
...` install lines. A README that drifts from the shipped scripts (a renamed script, a renamed
verb, a dropped line) therefore turns this control red; a README the control does not read could
drift silently. Since #277 every `python3` gesture under "What /agrim-init will ask you" and "If
/agrim-init says you lack access" is also EXECUTED (github mode, confirm variant, after the goal is
done), from the repository root, `<installed-sigma>` standing for the Sigma directory -- so a
gesture a user could not copy from their repository (a path relative to the plugin directory), a
renamed verb, or a placeholder nothing fills is red. The install lines (claude, codex, in-session `/plugin`) must match the plugin id
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` declares, and every init flag the Quickstart shows must be one
init_flow.py's parser accepts. Everything else comes from what /agrim-init PRINTS: the `[ask]`
lines (parsed in init_flow.ask_line's shape, `[ask] <id>: <prose> -> --flag VALUE|VALUE ; ...`,
and answered through ASK_POLICY, keyed by the flag NAME the line offers -- a renamed or new flag
is "unanswerable [ask]", red), the verify candidate number and id, and the `Next:` line's
`loop.py next` command. A README or printed command runs only in the pinned shape
`python3 <existing script under skills/ or tools/> <args without shell syntax>`, the script path
read from the repository root as a shell would (see _py_argv).

EVERY OTHER README GESTURE IS USAGE-CHECKED (#277 review). The two init subsections are executed;
every other `python3 <installed-sigma>/<script> ...` line ANYWHERE in the README (fenced, inline, in
a table or a `$(...)`) cannot be -- most of them need a live board or a running loop -- so each is
checked against the script's OWN usage instead: `<script> --help` runs (a pure print in every
shipped script; exit 0 required), and the gesture's verb, positional count and `--flags` must match
one of the usage alternatives it prints (see `usage_problems`). That is the decision, and its limit:
a gesture that PARSES but then does something other than its prose claims is not caught here --
that stays a prose review. Mode line `readme-usage`; red names the gesture and the usage it missed.

TWO VARIANTS per mode. `confirm`: a Makefile test target, confirmed by the README gesture
(enforce ON). `no-command`: a repository with nothing to confirm, the verify question left open,
so the default init SCAFFOLDS is what `record done` sees -- the only variant that can see the
original bug, because a confirm overwrites whatever default was scaffolded. In github mode the
no-command variant runs the REAL path, work ON (#312): PR, review gate, merge, done-means-merged,
exactly as the confirm variant does -- with enforce off and no command, `work.py merge` demands no
verify evidence (`state.verify_required`), so the approved merge must pass. Before #312 it parked
on "no fresh verify evidence", and an earlier version of this control hid that behind
`--local-only`. github mode passes `--repo` itself: no `[ask]` names it and the control's origin
is a local path.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO (see docs/onboarding-control.md for the owner runbook of each):
  * no model session. `/agrim-loop` is a model turn; this control drives the SAME scripts the
    agrim-loop skill tells the agent to run (`loop.py start/next/agent-start`, `work.py`,
    `phase_report.py`, `loop.py verify`, `loop.py record`), with the "work" itself scripted. Token
    cost is therefore N/A: `phase_report.py end` runs and prints its honest `cost: unavailable`
    line, which is recorded as-is.
  * no real GitHub. github mode runs against the stateful fake `gh` from
    tests/test_public_bootstrap_control.py (extracted by `ast`, one source for both) and a local
    bare `origin`. Every gh call is recorded; a call the fake does not model fails the run.
  * no write outside its own temp directory, except the OPTIONAL `--install` step, which runs the
    README's `claude plugin` / `codex plugin` lines into an ISOLATED profile (HOME,
    CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, CODEX_HOME all pointed inside the temp dir) and records a hash of the real
    profile's plugin surface before and after, so "untouched" is measured, not assumed.

USAGE
    python3 tools/onboarding_control.py [--mode local|github|both] [--variant confirm|no-command|all]
                                        [--sigma DIR] [--readme FILE]
                                        [--install none|claude|codex|all] [--from-install]
                                        [--json FILE] [--workdir DIR] [--keep]

EXIT: 0 = every requested mode and variant reached `done` and every assertion held; 1 = a step or
an assertion failed (the JSON names the first failing step); 2 = bad arguments or a missing
precondition (`git` / `make` not found, the README unreadable) -- never reported as green.

Stdlib only. POSIX only (a `make` test target and a `#!python` fake gh); on Windows it exits 2.
