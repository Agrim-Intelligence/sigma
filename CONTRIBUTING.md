# Contributing to Sigma Loop

Thank you for improving Sigma Loop. Please open an issue before substantial work so maintainers can
confirm the scope.

## Development setup

Sigma Loop needs Python 3.10 or newer. CI runs the full suite on Linux with Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13, and on
macOS with Python 3.12 only; macOS on other Python versions is untested. Install the test dependencies:

```sh
python -m pip install pytest pytest-xdist pyyaml
```

Run the suite before opening a pull request:

```sh
python -m pytest tests -q -n 4 -p no:cacheprovider
python3 tools/rename_check.py
```

The second command exits 1 and prints each file and line while any tracked path or file still carries
the retired skill prefix (every skill and command starts with `sigma-`); CI runs it on every pull
request. A branch cut before the rename lands fixes itself by taking the new paths and running the
rename tool once more, from the repository root:

```sh
python3 tools/rename_prefix.py
```

It refuses (exit 2, nothing moved) if the new folder already exists; `git mv` the files your branch
added under the old folder name into it by hand, then run it again.

## Working rules

Shipped code is stdlib-only. Every guard must be deliberately seen red once before its green run.
The five design properties — reliability, scalability, resiliency, safety, and liveness — and the
full agent rules are defined in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). Agents must emit status according to the
[output contract](docs/output-contract.md).

Work lands through `sdlc/*` branches and pull requests. Nobody commits directly to a `feature/*`
branch. Keep changes focused, add meaningful tests, and update the relevant documentation.
