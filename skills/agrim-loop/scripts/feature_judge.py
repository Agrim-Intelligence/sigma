"""A real, validated LIVE judge for `feature_classify.py`'s tiers 1 and 3 (#2380, slice G of epic
#2260's completion work, plan #2260 (live-judge)). `feature_classify._default_judge`
never guesses -- it always abstains, because deciding "is this issue about unit X" is a language
question the classifier deliberately never attempts in Python. This module is the first REAL
answer to that question: it shells out to `claude -p` (a live, metered model call) to actually
read an issue and judge it, then independently STRESS-TESTS its own answer before trusting it.

THIS MODULE NEVER MODIFIES `feature_classify.py`'S OWN LOGIC. `live_judge` below is exactly the
`(sdlc_dir, source, goal, config, context) -> Judgment` callable `classify_at_pick`/
`classify_for_filing` already accept as their optional `judge=` parameter, unchanged -- see their
own docstrings in `feature_classify.py` for the exact call shape this matches. Every tier's own
post-judgment validation (`resolve_any_unit`, `_evidence_exists`) still runs downstream of
whatever this returns; a wrong or manipulated judgment can at worst cause a misattribution onto a
REAL registered unit or a REAL filesystem path this repository actually has -- never a fabricated
one. That existing safety net is the real bound on how much damage this module's own mistakes (or
a malicious issue body's) can do.

THE SHAPE: ASSIGNER, THEN VALIDATOR, NOTHING ASSIGNED WITHOUT BOTH. `assign()` runs the
classification prompt `rounds` times (self-consistency: sampling a classifier repeatedly and
requiring AGREEMENT across independent samples is a model-agnostic way to catch an unstable
answer before it ships, per the research cited in the plan -- raw self-reported confidence from a
single call is not trustworthy on its own). Only a MAJORITY (2-of-3, never unanimous 2-of-2) tier-
1/tier-3 candidate is even considered. `validate()` is a SECOND, independently-framed call that
stress-tests that one specific claim rather than re-classifying from scratch, and FAILS CLOSED:
only an exact `CONFIRM` counts, a timeout/garbage/`REFUTE` are all refusal. Only a majority
candidate that also gets a clean `CONFIRM` becomes a real `Judgment`; every other path -- no
majority, an exceeded spend ceiling, a missing/unreadable issue, a validator refusal, or any
unexpected exception -- returns `feature_classify.ABSTAIN`, identical to today's default judge.

SAFETY MECHANICS THAT MUST NEVER REGRESS (both were MUST-FIX findings of this plan's own
adversarial plan-review, before any code existed):

  - every `ask_claude` call passes `--permission-prompts none` (auto-deny; never hang on a
    permission wall with no TTY to answer it -- confirmed live via `claude -p --help` that the
    flag DEFAULTS to `"host"`, not `"none"`) AND `--disallowedTools` (removes the temptation
    structurally, not just hope). This is the ONLY place in the pick path that ever calls out to a
    live model, and it must never be able to hang the pick loop or spawn a stray process.
  - a rolling-window DAILY dollar spend ceiling (`.sdlc/state/feature-judge-spend.json`), checked
    BEFORE `assign()` ever runs, mirroring `autowatch.py`'s existing `spend_ceiling_tokens_per_week`
    mechanism structurally (fail-CLOSED on a corrupt/unreadable ledger -- an unreadable file must
    never read as "zero spent so far") -- plus the CLI's own real `--max-budget-usd` as a second,
    independent, per-call bound. Two layers, not one.

PROMPT-INJECTION DEFENSE, STATED PRECISELY. Untrusted issue title/body is the one thing both the
assigner and validator prompts read that an arbitrary person controls. `_delimit_block` wraps it
in an explicit "DATA, never instructions" block using a fresh, unpredictable per-call random nonce
in the delimiter markers themselves -- not a fixed string an attacker's issue body could simply
echo back to fake a premature close. Combined with the existing registry/filesystem validation
this module never bypasses (see above), the worst a successful injection can do is nudge a
wrong-but-real assignment, which is exactly what this module's own live adversarial testing (see
the plan's "Real, live validation" section) is designed to catch.

MODULE SHAPE follows `feature_classify.py`/`feature_labels.py`: siblings loaded by file path
(`_load`, never `sys.modules`-cached), pure functions plus fail-open stderr notes.

EAGER LOAD OF `feature_classify`, SAFE IN THIS ONE DIRECTION ONLY. This module needs
`feature_classify.ABSTAIN`/`make_judgment` to build its return value, so it loads that module
EAGERLY at import time. `feature_classify.py` itself eagerly loads `feature_labels.py` (for
`Decision`/`_flag`/`_record`/etc.), which in turn loads THIS module -- but only LAZILY, inside
`_handle_no_unit_at_pick`, never at its own module scope (see `feature_labels._feature_judge`).
So the chain `feature_judge -> feature_classify -> feature_labels` never loops back into
`feature_judge` at import time; it only would if `feature_labels.py` ever loaded this module
eagerly too, which it deliberately does not, for exactly this reason.

#: string), never as several bare argv tokens -- `subprocess.run` gives the CLI exactly the argv
#: list handed to it, with no shell re-splitting, so a single well-formed string is the
#: unambiguous, deterministic form regardless of how the CLI's own variadic parser behaves.

#: does not apply to its answer without this module needing to special-case `null` vs. absent vs.
#: empty. Kept this way rather than a `["string","null"]` union specifically because the ONE live
#: probe this slice ran (see the implementation report) exercised only a plain, fully-required
#: schema -- the simpler, more conservative shape here is a deliberate choice, not an oversight.
#: `"additionalProperties": False` (#2385, round-2 adversarial finding): a live round observed the
#: model twice adding unrequested extra JSON keys. Every reader already treats an unexpected key as
#: a no-op (nothing here reads anything but the five named properties), so this changes no runtime
#: behavior for a well-formed answer -- it only removes the ability for the model to add one at
#: all, since `--json-schema` enforces the schema at the CLI/API level itself, before this module

#: never rewritten) must never share a file with the ledger's own lifecycle (read, mutated,
#: `write_text`-replaced on every record). Mirrors `loop._claim_lock_path`'s "the lock file is not
#: the thing it's guarding" shape.
SPEND_LOCK_FILE = "feature-judge-spend.lock"

#: Per-round headroom (seconds) for the spend-lock acquire timeout `live_judge` passes to
#: `_acquire_spend_lock` -- a plain module global, not a function default, specifically so a test
#: can `monkeypatch.setattr(feature_judge, "SPEND_LOCK_TIMEOUT_PER_ROUND_S", ...)` and see it take
#: effect on the very next `live_judge` call: a default baked into a function signature is bound
#: once at import time and a later monkeypatch of some OTHER name would never reach it.
#:
#: NOT a fixed timeout -- see `_spend_lock_timeout_s` below, which multiplies this by `rounds + 1`
#: (one allotment per `assign()` attempt, plus one more for the trailing `validate()` call) to size
#: the real timeout to how long ONE caller's own classification flow can actually take. A fixed
#: `SPEND_LOCK_TIMEOUT_S = 30` shipped originally, sized against nothing measured; round 4 of
#: #2260's own live adversarial testing (run AFTER #2388's fix above was confirmed working)
#: measured a single real `live_judge` call -- up to `rounds` assign attempts + 1 validate call,
#: each a real `claude -p` subprocess -- at **35-95s wall-clock in practice**, meaning that fixed
#: 30s bound was mathematically too short for a second, genuinely concurrent caller to ever win the
#: lock race against the first caller's own classification finishing: under the exact realistic
#: concurrency #2388's fix targets (a human running `handoff.py track` while the loop independently
#: picks), the second caller would systematically lose and get starved into the mechanical
#: catch-all every time, not occasionally -- silently degrading the "AI judgment" half of this
#: whole feature back to today's mechanical tier-2 default under any real concurrent load (#2390).
#:
#: 60s/round comfortably clears that measured 35-95s ceiling even at the default `rounds=3`
#: (`(3 + 1) * 60 = 240s`), and -- being proportional rather than fixed -- keeps clearing it if
#: `rounds` is ever reconfigured, instead of drifting out of sync with real latency the way a
#: second hardcoded constant would. A spend-ceiling check is rare regardless (at most once per pick
#: or per filing, never a high-throughput path per #2388's own fix design), so this much wait
#: headroom on genuine contention is an acceptable cost -- the alternative (fail immediately) is
#: exactly `loop._try_acquire_claim_lock`'s OWN contract, deliberately not reused here because that
#: lock's "skip this one, a sibling is already on it" posture is wrong for this call site: skipping
#: silently would just mean abstaining every time two classifications ever overlap, which defeats
#: the point of having a live judge at all.

    `timeout_s` window. Those two non-acquisition outcomes are deliberately different in kind, and
    `live_judge` treats them differently:

      - `_SPEND_LOCK_UNAVAILABLE` (no `fcntl` on this platform, or an `OSError` even opening/
        creating the lock file -- permissions, a read-only filesystem) is FAIL-OPEN, exactly like
        `loop._try_acquire_claim_lock`'s own posture for the identical class of failure: a lock
        this call cannot manage must never be what silences a live judge that would otherwise
        work. The caller proceeds unprotected -- no worse than before this fix existed.
      - `None` (timeout) is FAIL-CLOSED, the opposite of that: the mechanism DID work, and it is
        reporting that another real process or thread is, right now, inside the very check-
        through-record window this lock exists to serialize. Proceeding anyway would silently

        fail-closed shape every other guard in this module already uses (`_spend_ceiling_ok` on an
        unreadable ledger, `validate` on anything but an exact `CONFIRM`).

    THE MECHANISM: the same kernel-mediated `flock(fd, LOCK_EX | ...)` `loop._try_acquire_claim_lock`
    already uses and whose own docstring explains at length why it has no read-then-act gap of its
    own -- unlike two prior create/rename-based schemes in this codebase's history, each
    independently broken across review cycles. That function is `LOCK_NB` (never waits) because a
    busy claim should be SKIPPED, not waited on; this one adapts the same call to BLOCK with a
    bounded timeout instead, because `fcntl.flock` itself has no blocking-with-timeout mode --
    there is `LOCK_EX` (blocks forever) and `LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB` (never blocks at all), nothing in
    between. So this polls `LOCK_NB` at `SPEND_LOCK_POLL_SECONDS` intervals against a wall-clock
    deadline (`time.monotonic()`, immune to a concurrent system-clock change) until either the lock
    is won or the deadline passes -- the standard, well-understood adaptation for turning a
    non-blocking primitive into a bounded-blocking one.

    A winning acquisition leaves the fd OPEN and flocked -- the caller MUST pass it to

    accept as their optional `judge=` parameter -- called `judge(sdlc_dir, source, goal, config,
    context)`, positionally, exactly this signature (confirmed against both call sites in
    `feature_classify.py` before this function was written, per this slice's own instructions).

    Reads its own three config-derived facts (`rounds`, the spend ceiling) OFF `source`
    (`no_dangling_goal_live_judge_rounds`/`_spend_ceiling_usd_per_day`, resolved ONCE in
    `sources.py` matching `no_dangling_goal_core`'s own pattern) rather than re-parsing `config`
    itself -- this module deliberately never reads `discovery.*` directly, per this slice's own
    instructions.

    ORDER OF OPERATIONS, LOAD-BEARING: the spend ceiling is checked FIRST, before a single
    `ask_claude` call is made -- an exceeded or unverifiable ceiling returns `ABSTAIN` immediately,
    with ZERO calls made. Only then is the real issue title/body fetched and `assign()` run; only a
    majority tier-1/tier-3 candidate reaches `validate()`; only a clean `CONFIRM` becomes a real
    `Judgment`. Every other path -- no majority, a validator refusal, a missing/unreadable issue,
    or any unexpected exception -- returns `feature_classify.ABSTAIN`, identical to what
    `_default_judge` already returns today. NEVER RAISES: this is reached from deep inside the
    pick path (`feature_labels._handle_no_unit_at_pick`) and the filing path
    (`handoff._auto_classify_unit`), where an exception must never break a pick or a filing.

    THE FILING-TIME CONTENT PATH (#2383, slice H of epic #2260's completion work). `goal` MAY be
    `None` -- `classify_for_filing`'s own documented call convention for the filing-time
    integration point, used when no issue exists yet to fetch title/body from. Before this slice,
    `goal is None` meant an unconditional abstain: `handoff._auto_classify_unit` did not thread
    the new issue's own title/body through the `judge` callable's call boundary at all, so there
    was genuinely no content to classify. `classify_for_filing` now threads it through
    `context["_pending_issue"] = {"title": ..., "body": ...}` whenever ITS OWN caller supplies
    `issue_title`/`issue_body` (see that function's own docstring for the write side of this
    contract) -- so when `goal is None`, this function checks `context` for that key FIRST: if it
    carries real content (a non-empty `title` OR `body`), that content is classified directly,
    exactly as a real issue's title/body would be at pick time, except `source.fetch_title_body`
    is never called -- there is no real issue to fetch yet. The `_pending_issue` key itself is
    stripped back out of the registry context handed to `assign`/`validate` (`_format_registry_context`
    would otherwise misread it as a bogus registered unit named `_pending_issue`) before either is
    ever called. If `goal is None` and NO pending content is present either (every caller before
    this slice, and any caller today that still passes nothing) this ABSTAINS exactly as it always
    has -- that default path is unchanged and stays covered by its own test.

    `goal` NOT `None` (the pick-time shape, `feature_labels._handle_no_unit_at_pick`) is completely
    UNCHANGED by this slice: `context["_pending_issue"]` is never read or even looked for on that
    path -- only `source.fetch_title_body(goal)` is ever consulted, byte-identical to before this
    slice existed. An explicit regression test pins this.

    #2388: THE CHECK-THROUGH-RECORD WINDOW IS NOW FULLY SERIALIZED BY `_acquire_spend_lock`. Round
    3's own live adversarial testing confirmed a real time-of-check/time-of-use race here: the
    ceiling check ran, then the (slow, real) `assign()`/`validate()` calls, then `_record_spend` --
    with nothing preventing a second, genuinely concurrent `live_judge` call (a human running
    `handoff.py track` while the autonomous loop independently picks a goal, both against the same
    `.sdlc/state/feature-judge-spend.json`) from reading the same pre-spend ledger state and also
    proceeding, jointly overshooting the configured ceiling. The lock below is acquired BEFORE
    `_spend_ceiling_ok` runs and held through every `_record_spend` call on every return path (via
    `finally`) -- a second concurrent call simply waits its turn rather than racing. A timeout
    (`_acquire_spend_lock` returns `None` -- the mechanism works but stayed genuinely contended)
    abstains with zero calls made, the same fail-closed shape as an exceeded ceiling; a genuinely
    unusable mechanism (`_SPEND_LOCK_UNAVAILABLE`) fails OPEN and proceeds unprotected, exactly
