"""The registry entry copied to sibling repos, one-directionally (#1477, epic #1464, story #1427).

#1473 records a goal under its unit in THIS repo. This is the half that reaches the OTHERS, and
§7.1 states the whole of what it must do:

    Each participating repo's `.sdlc/features/` carries the WHOLE entry -- both repos' branches and
    both repos' goals -- not just its own half.

The reason is durability of understanding: somebody who later loses access to one repo, or who only
ever had one, can still see the whole picture of what that unit was instead of seeing half of it and
guessing. A registry describing only its own side is exactly as incomplete as no registry, for the
person who needs it most. Sigma performs the copy on goal pick, because a human step that must
happen in two repos is a step that will be half-done.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE THREE RULES, AND WHAT EACH ONE REFUSES

1. THE COPY IS WHOLE, AND A HALF ENTRY IS WORSE THAN NONE. `feature_registry.read` REPLACES a unit's
   entry with its shard rather than merging the two, so whatever a write omits is gone from the
   effective registry -- and the loss becomes permanent the moment anything folds the shards back
   into the chart sheet. That cuts both ways here, and both directions are defended:

     - LOCALLY, a pick that wrote only what it knew (its own repo) would erase the sheet's other
       repos. `feature_sync.amend` already read-modify-writes the EFFECTIVE entry for exactly this
       reason; nothing in this module weakens it;
     - REMOTELY, copying our entry over the destination's would erase the goals that repo recorded
       ITSELF and has not propagated back yet. So the copy is a read-modify-write against the
       destination too (`merge_entry`), never a blind overwrite. §7.1's "a file copy, not a merge of
       a shared table" is about not merging one SHARED table across units; a per-unit shard is
       literally the file it means, and reconciling two versions of that one file is what keeps the
       copy whole rather than lossy.

2. DISCOVERY FLOWS ONE WAY: REGISTRY -> REPOS, NEVER REPO -> REGISTRY. Propagation reaches the repos
   `repos` already names. A goal picked in a repo that is NOT named, referencing an existing unit, is
   the other direction -- a SCOPE EXPANSION, which §7.3 makes the unit owner's decision. It lands as
   `sdlc:needs-confirmation` plus a ledger entry to the UNIT owner, and never a silent registry edit.
   Adding the repo automatically because a goal mentioned a label would let any issue in any repo
   widen a unit into a codebase its owner never agreed to touch -- through the one field the registry
   exists to be authoritative about.

   THE RULE IS ENFORCED IN TWO LAYERS BECAUSE IT HAS TWO ENTRY POINTS. `gate_at_pick` refuses the
   pick before anything is built, which needs a backlog source and therefore only exists inside the
   loop; `feature_sync._record_goal` refuses the WRITE, which is reached by a bare `work.py start`
   run by hand as well. Either alone leaves a hole: the gate cannot defend a hand-run start, and the
   registry refusal cannot stop the goal from being worked. Together, `repos` is unchanged on every
   path and the goal is inert on the one that matters.

   AN ENTRY NAMING NO REPOS IS NOT AN EXPANSION. It has made no statement about scope -- `repos` is
   filled by propagation, so an empty block is the ordinary state of every freshly-recorded unit
   (`cross_repo.decide` names the same case for the same reason). An entry naming `a/b` and not
   `c/d` HAS made one, and widening it is somebody's decision.

3. MISSING ACCESS LOSES NOTHING AND BLOCKS NOTHING. Where Sigma cannot write a sibling it
   updates the end it can and ledgers the rest, addressed to that repo's owner (§7.3), so anybody
   who does have access can complete it. `ledger.py` already has a `to` field and `addressed_to()`;
   no new transport, exactly as the issue requires. The half that could not be written is never
   silently dropped and never blocks the half that could -- two siblings, one reachable, still lands
   the reachable one.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NO WRITE TO A FOREIGN REPO WITHOUT A MEASURED `granted`, AND THAT IS INHERITED RATHER THAN INVENTED

This module never asks GitHub whether it may write somewhere. It reads the verdict #1472 already
recorded at pick (`cross_repo.recorded`), and writes ONLY on `granted`. `unknown` is not a soft
`granted` -- it selects no action at all, exactly as it selects no tier there.

That inheritance is worth more than the saved API call. `check_access` refuses to return ANY verdict
from an identity it could not pin, because `gh`'s active account is a device-global keyring slot any
other tool can switch. So a drifted account yields `unknown`, and `unknown` writes nothing: a
misconfigured machine can never commit into a stranger's repository through this path. Re-asking
here would have had to re-derive that whole argument, and a second answer to one question is how the
two drift.

The cost of the same rule is stated rather than hidden: `check_at_pick` runs in `loop._next`, so a
goal started outside the loop has NO recorded decision, and every sibling is then held and ledgered
rather than written. That is the safe direction, it is visible in the report and on the console, and
the next pick through the loop repairs it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT IS COPIED, AND WHAT DELIBERATELY IS NOT

WHAT A COPY DOES NOT PRESERVE, said before the list of what it does: `registry.parse` ->
`normalise_entry` is a WHITELIST, so a field a newer Sigma adds inside `sigma/features@1` --
an entry-level key, or a per-repo one -- does not survive the round trip and is dropped from the
sibling's file. The refusal in `_their_entry` covers a schema-STRING bump and nothing narrower. So
an addition to an entry requires a schema bump, or a peer on an older plugin erases it; that rule is
recorded beside `feature_registry.SCHEMA`, which is where the schema is owned.

ONLY `units/<name>.json`. Not `index.json` -- it is the DERIVED chart sheet, written by an explicit
fold and never on a pick path, and copying it would carry every OTHER unit's state into a repo that
has its own. Not `<name>.md` either, and that one is a ruling rather than an omission: the `.md` is
the human-readable projection, its managed block is regenerated from the entry by `feature_doc.sync`
on the receiving repo's own next pick, and it carries a human-owned prose region below that block
which a blind Contents-API write cannot see and would destroy. The structured record is the thing
§7.1 is about; the projection follows it locally, where the file's own bytes are in hand.

THE DESTINATION IS THE SIBLING'S DEFAULT BRANCH, which is what omitting `branch` from the Contents
API selects. Not the unit's feature branch: the registry exists BECAUSE a feature branch can be
deleted and take every trace of the unit with it, so a backup living on that same branch would not
be one. §4's "nobody commits directly to a feature branch" points the same way.

THE HONEST LIMIT: `main` under required status checks (§9's default) refuses a direct write, and the
refusal arrives here as a failed write -- which is ledgered to that repo's owner, with the reason
GitHub gave, rather than retried or hidden. That is tier 2's promise applied to the registry copy:
nothing is lost when access is missing.

Module shape follows `feature_sync.py`: zero third-party dependencies, module-level constants,
siblings loaded by file path, every ledger write fail-open, and nothing here may break a pick.

    THE REFUSAL IS `feature_registry.unit_path`'S, not a second copy of it -- and ONLY the refusal.
    This is a path in a repository we do not even own, the one destination where a name that escapes
    its directory would be worst, so the guard is borrowed rather than reimplemented. Calling it and
    then building the string with explicit `/` joins is deliberate: the GitHub Contents API
    addresses POSIX paths, and `pathlib` on Windows would hand it backslashes.

    THE FILENAME IS BORROWED TOO, AND THAT IS #1672. It used to be rebuilt here from the RAW name
    while only the refusal was delegated, so this wrote `units/Voice.json` into a sibling whose own
    picks write `units/voice.json` -- two shards for one unit, in someone else's registry, created
    by us. The fix is not a local `name.lower()`: that would be a SECOND definition of the fold,
    free to drift from `unit_path` exactly as three previous rounds of this bug drifted (#1566,
    #1577, #1638). So the basename is read off what the delegate already returned, and the
    guard/fold ORDERING comes with it -- `is_unit_name` rejects `voice.lock` and accepts
    `voice.LOCK`, so a fold applied before the guard would turn an accepted name into the spelling
    of a rejected one, and that ordering now cannot be rearranged from here.

    WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: a `units/<Name>.json` an older plugin already wrote into a sibling stays
    there. It is inert -- `feature_registry.read` globs sorted and last-file-wins, and the folded
    spelling sorts last -- but this module does not delete in a tree it does not own. Measured while
    fixing it: a sibling holding its own `units/voice.json` had its recorded goals read as `{}` by
    the OLD address and merged correctly by this one, so the fold is what PRESERVES that repo's
    entry, not what endangers it.

    Only `PurePath.name` crosses over, never the assembled path: the explicit `/` join stays because
    the GitHub Contents API addresses POSIX paths and `pathlib` on Windows would hand it backslashes.

    repo recorded itself and has not propagated back yet, which is the same half-entry failure
    `write_unit` documents locally, committed into a repository we do not own.

    THE RULES, EACH CHOSEN RATHER THAN FALLEN INTO:

      - `title`, `owner`, `parent`, `tracking_issue`: filled where the destination states nothing,
        never replaced. Propagation makes a repo's picture COMPLETE; it does not adjudicate whose
        wording is right;

        Closing a unit is a human's decision recorded where they took it, and reopening one is
        `feature_sync.reconcile`'s explicit non-decision -- a copy that could close (or reopen)
        somebody else's unit would be the loudest possible violation of "never a silent registry
        edit". The `in` test is load-bearing and cannot be replaced by reading the normalised value:
        `normalise_entry` applies the `open: true` DEFAULT, so an absent key and a stated `true` are
        indistinguishable afterwards -- and a first copy into a repo that has no file yet would then
        silently reopen a unit our own entry says is closed;
      - `repos`: the UNION of the keys, because that is the whole picture §7.1 asks for. Per repo,
        `branch` and `owner` are filled where empty, and `goals` is an order-preserving union with
        the destination's own order kept first -- `feature_registry._goals` de-duplicates and
        coerces, so appending blindly is correct and idempotent;
      - `authorized`: the DESTINATION'S, always, and never propagated. It is the board owner's
        per-feature grant (§7.3), and copying `true` into a repo would let one repo's registry hand

def _their_entry(current, unit):
    """-> `(the destination's entry for this unit, the key IT spells it with, its WHOLE document)`.

    THE WHOLE DOCUMENT COMES BACK BECAUSE THE WRITE MUST NOT DELETE WHAT IT DID NOT COME FOR (F7).
    A `units/<name>.json` carrying a second unit key is malformed by `_read_unit_file`'s own rule
    and nothing readable is lost by dropping it -- but an unannounced deletion in a foreign tree is
    exactly what this module's stated rule ("a file we cannot read is not a file we may replace")
    exists to refuse. Rebuilding the document around the other keys costs nothing and deletes
    nothing.

    RAISES `_Unreadable` WHENEVER A FILE IS THERE AND DOES NOT YIELD THIS UNIT, and that refusal is
    the point of the function. `parse` degrades an unknown schema, a non-object, or a key that is
    not a unit name to "nothing readable" -- which is its specified behaviour and exactly right for a
    READER, and a licence to overwrite for nobody. Without this, a destination carrying a
    `sigma/features@2` document (or one this version simply cannot parse) would merge into `{}`,
    produce our entry verbatim, and be CLOBBERED with it -- the half-entry failure §7.1 forbids,
    performed on the file a future version of this tool wrote.

    THE PREDICATE IS `_read_unit_file`'S, borrowed rather than re-derived: what a unit file may speak
    for is bounded by its own filename, matched CASE-INSENSITIVELY, and a file that names a different
    unit than its path is one `feature_registry.read` already drops rather than trusts. The key that
    comes back is the DESTINATION'S OWN SPELLING, for that function's reason -- that is what its
    author wrote, and a copy is not the place to correct it.

    THE PROMISE THIS REFUSAL MAKES IS EXACTLY ONE SCHEMA VERSION WIDE (F6). It stops a document
    whose `schema` STRING this version cannot read from being replaced. It does NOT preserve fields
    a future Sigma adds INSIDE `sigma/features@1`: `registry.parse` -> `normalise_entry` is
    a whitelist, so any entry-level or per-repo key outside the `@1` schema is dropped on the way
    through and does not come back out in the document this copy writes. The consequence is a rule
    for the schema rather than a bug here, and it is stated where `SCHEMA` is defined: an addition
    to an entry requires a schema BUMP, because a peer running an older Sigma will otherwise
    erase it from the sibling's file on the next pick. `test_a_field_added_inside_at1_is_dropped_by_a_copy`
    pins the behaviour so it is known rather than discovered.

                                     one ledger entry to the unit owner.
      - THE MARK DID NOT LAND     -> REFUSE, `marked` False, and write NOTHING durable -- no comment,
                                     no ledger entry. `feature_labels`' REFUSED_WRITE_FAILED rule
                                     verbatim: a write that did not land is not evidence of a state,
                                     so nothing may claim one, and a network blip must not summon a
                                     human. It is also what bounds the noise: the goal keeps
                                     `sdlc:goal`, so it is re-picked, and a note written here would
                                     be written again on every pick until the blip cleared.
                                     `loop._next` skips it for this call and the next pick retries.
      - THE SOURCE HAS NO SURFACE -> PROCEED. `LocalSource` has none of these methods and no
                                     repository label namespace at all; refusing forever with no way
                                     to signal is the "issue nobody can find" this codebase never
                                     converges on. `feature_sync._record_goal` still refuses the
                                     registry widening on that path, so `repos` is unchanged either
                                     way -- the goal is worked, and the field is defended.

    THE LEDGER ENTRY IS RAISED ONLY WHEN THE PICK IS ACTUALLY REFUSED, and that is not a detail. A
    refused pick never reaches `work.start()`, so `feature_sync._surface` -- which ledgers the same
    finding to the same owner -- never runs for it. When this gate PROCEEDS, that pass does run and
    does raise it. One event, one note, on every path.

    THE ONE RESIDUE, NAMED RATHER THAN LEFT TO BE FOUND. `blockers.classify` returns `PROMOTED` for
    an issue carrying BOTH `sdlc:followup` and `sdlc:needs-confirmation` (`blockers.py`, the
    `proposed_label` arm), and `blockers._act` then grants membership back and strips the proposal
    label -- reached through `verdict_for`/`resolve`/`_act` and `auto_unpark`, whenever something
    declares itself blocked by that issue. That is `docs/label-model.md` §2's "Sigma's OWN
    unapproved follow-up" row, justified there by `needs-confirmation` meaning *no human has ever
    ruled on it*. A goal held HERE has been ruled on, just not on this question, so the promotion
    undoes this refusal.

    (`sources._promote_blockers` is NOT the promoter and an earlier version of this note said it
    was. That function is #900's PRIORITY promotion and never writes a lifecycle label. The wrong
    pointer is recorded rather than quietly swapped, because it also reached `docs/label-model.md`,
    which `AGENTS.md` calls the contract for every `sdlc:*` label.)

    HOW REACHABLE IT ACTUALLY IS, re-derived rather than waved at. A `{followup, needs-confirmation}`
    issue is not pickable at all (`not_eligible_labels` refuses `proposed_label`), so this gate can
    only put an issue INTO that shape after a human promoted it out of it. The full path is: #1471
    stamps unit U onto a follow-up Sigma files in repo R; a human promotes it; it is picked;
    this gate refuses it, restoring `needs-confirmation` beside the permanent `sdlc:followup`; and
    something then names it as a blocker. R need not have been listed at the parent's pick either --
    `Gate(True, NO_ENTRY, ...)` proceeds for a unit with no entry yet, and a later hand edit can
    create U naming only S, or remove R from it. So it is a real path, not a nearly-impossible one.

    IT IS BOUNDED, WHICH IS THE PART THAT MAKES LEAVING IT DEFENSIBLE. The promotion fires on a
    BLOCKER event (a block being recorded, or an unpark sweep), not on every pick, so the worst case
    is one promote/refuse pair per such event -- two label swaps -- and never the unbounded flap
    `feature_labels` measured for `sdlc:blocked`. The goal ends each cycle inert, which is the safe
    end.

    WHAT WOULD CLOSE IT, for whoever does: `classify` decides on LABELS alone and cannot see the
    flag comment this gate posts, so distinguishing "held for scope" from "never ruled on" needs a
    signal in the label set. Choosing one is a change to that row's policy, which is ownership
    enforcement's (#1479) to make; guessing at it from here would be a second opinion about a
    contract this goal does not own."""

    # Read the whole of this before reinstating anything: the obvious repair has been tried, shipped
    # and reverted, and the paragraphs below are in the order the argument actually went.
    #
    # 1. WHAT #1568 REPORTED, AND IT IS STILL TRUE. Propagation is ONE-DIRECTIONAL -- an entry only
    #    ever reaches repos the unit already lists -- so a repo the unit does NOT list is, by
    #    construction, a repo whose registry is empty. The proceed condition below ("a unit nobody
    #    has recorded is CREATED by this pick") is therefore identical to the condition defining the
    #    expansion this gate exists to catch. The gate cannot fire in its own case.
    #
    # 2. WHAT WAS TRIED. A second arm asked the REMOTE whether `feature/<unit>` already existed,
    #    reasoning that a unit live elsewhere is not a unit this pick is creating. It was routed
    #    around `is_scope_expansion` rather than through it, because that predicate answers False
    #    for an entry naming no repos -- deliberately, since an empty `repos` block is the ordinary
    #    state of every freshly recorded unit.
    #
    # 3. WHY IT WAS WITHDRAWN. It is wrong against this project's OWN documented adoption order:
    #    §14 pushes the branch FIRST and declares the unit LAST. So on the first pick of a brand-new
    #    unit the branch exists, the registry is adopted, and no entry names the unit -- which is
    #    indistinguishable from the expansion the arm was meant to catch. Measured: that pick had
    #    `sdlc:goal` stripped and was set aside, so every first adoption refused itself.
    #
    # 4. WHAT THAT LEAVES. There is no LOCAL evidence separating the two states, and the one remote
    #    fact to hand does not separate them either -- both show an empty registry and a live
    #    branch. A gate that blocks all adoption is strictly worse than a gate that cannot fire, so
    #    this returns to the prior behaviour and #1568 carries what was learned. A real fix needs
    #    evidence from the unit's HOME registry, which this gate does not have and does not fetch.
    #
    # `promote._feature_hold` mirrors this exactly and says so; the two must not drift apart again.
