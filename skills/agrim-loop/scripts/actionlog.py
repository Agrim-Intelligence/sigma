"""Local-only action log: a full-granularity trace of what Sigma is doing right now — every
file touched, model/effort choice, subagent dispatch/completion, and every mechanically-guaranteed
loop action (claim/worktree/verify/gate/record) — kept entirely separate from the team ledger
(ledger.py). Answers "what is Sigma doing, on which goal, in which thread" from a local file
read alone, no live agent inspection needed (see the sibling `agrim-log` skill).

WHY NOT THE LEDGER. The ledger is shared, git-tracked, meant for team-visible coordination events
(claim/done/parked/handoff) — not a full local action trace at file-touch granularity. This module
copies the ledger's CALLING SHAPE (JSONL, one line per event, a closed kind vocabulary, a
safe_append that never raises) but never its sink, its per-actor-pid file design, or its
vocabulary. Zero coupling to ledger.py BY CONSTRUCTION, not just convention — this module never
imports it (mirrors loop.py's own `_flags()` precedent: "loop.py/ledger.py stay decoupled —
neither imports the other's private helpers today"). The read side (`skills/agrim-log/`) does not
import this module either — format-only coupling, the same relationship status.py already has to
state.py's STATE.md.

ONE FILE PER GOAL (`.sdlc/state/log/<stem(goal)>.jsonl`), not per actor/pid like the ledger.
Concurrency here is at the GOAL level (`next_batch`, inter-goal) and the SLICE level (`slices.py`,
intra-goal) — never the individual-CLI-invocation level the ledger's per-pid scheme defends
against. Partitioning by goal means two DIFFERENT goals' subagents structurally never contend on
the same file, and `agrim-log goal <id>` never reads more than that one goal ever produced.

LOCAL-ONLY, BY DESIGN. `.sdlc/state/log/` lives under `.sdlc/state/`, already covered by
`skills/agrim-setup/scripts/setup.py`'s `RUNTIME_IGNORES` + `ensure_ignore()` — no new gitignore
code needed. Never touches git, never touches the ledger's shared `sdlc-ledger` ops branch.

Default OFF (`action_log.enabled`, strict `is True`, mirroring `ledger.enabled()`'s idiom exactly):
matches every other additive feature in this repo (ledger/journal/parallel/backlog_check/
session_start/stop_gate) — a repo that has not opted in behaves exactly as before this module
existed. Zero deps.

WHO WRITES. Mechanically-guaranteed Python-layer call sites (`loop.py::_next/_record/verify_goal`,
`work.py::start/merge/post_review`) use `safe_append()` with `INTERNAL_KINDS` — never reachable
from the CLI, so an agent can never forge one. Everything only the agent can see is agent-emitted
via `loop.py log`, a NEW CLI verb scoped to the separate `AGENT_KINDS` vocabulary — that allowlist
split is the CALLER's job (`loop.py log`'s own dispatch checks `kind in AGENT_KINDS` before ever
reaching `append()` here), mirroring how `_EMIT_KINDS` already fences `loop.py emit` off from the
ledger's own Class-1 kinds without `ledger.append` itself needing to know about that split.
