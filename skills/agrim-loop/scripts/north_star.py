"""Where the project's north-star actually IS — and "there is none" told apart from "I could not look".

THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR (#1778). `agrim-research` §4 and `agrim-plan-review` §4 both gate their
strategy/architecture check on a bare `.sdlc/context/north-star.md` exists?` against the CURRENT
DIRECTORY. The loop runs both phases from inside the goal's WORKTREE (`agrim-loop/SKILL.md` 3a: "do
every edit for this goal inside that worktree"), and `.gitignore` excludes `.sdlc/*` — so that file
is never in a worktree. Measured on this repo the day the fix was written: main checkout
`.sdlc/context/north-star.md` = 11,523 bytes; `.sdlc/work/1778/.sdlc/` = `changelog-fragments/` and
`design/` only, no `context/` at all.

And it is worse than a no-op, which is the whole reason this module returns THREE values rather than
a boolean. `agrim-plan-review` read that absence as "no north-star = drop-in project: skip this check;
it's a no-op" — i.e. it reported NOT APPLICABLE when the truth was I COULD NOT LOOK. That is the
repo's ABSENT-is-not-PASS rule broken in its purest form, so:

    present      a north-star was found and read      -> run the check
    absent       we know where to look; nothing there -> skip, exactly as a drop-in project always did
    unreachable  we could not establish where to look -> NEITHER of the above; say so in the verdict

RESOLVE, DON'T REFUSE. A review gate that hard-refuses on a diagnostic failure converts one missing
binary into a fleet-wide stall on every plan-review forever, which AGENTS.md RESILIENCY forbids
("recovery must not itself be an outage"). The refusal that IS correct here is refusing to CLAIM the
check passed: `unreachable` is a stated gap the verdict has to carry, the same shape
`review_context._missing` already uses ("a review missing a required input reads ABSENT, never
PASS"). So this module never raises and never exits non-zero on a resolution failure — it types it.

HOW RESOLUTION WORKS. `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` is the primitive: a linked worktree's own
`.git` is a text FILE pointing at the main checkout's `.git`, and the common dir is that main `.git`
(absolute), while an ordinary clone answers with its own `.git`. Its parent is therefore the working
tree that owns `.sdlc`. Confirmed live from this goal's worktree: `--git-common-dir` ->
`/Users/.../sigma/.git`, `--show-toplevel` -> `/Users/.../sigma/.sdlc/work/1778`. A SUBMODULE's
common dir is `<super>/.git/modules/<name>`, whose parent is not a working tree at all — hence the
basename check, which falls back to `--show-toplevel` (the submodule's own checkout, which is the
right root for it).

WHEN GIT ITSELF CANNOT ANSWER, the `.git` entry's own TYPE decides, and this is why `unreachable` is
a state that can actually occur rather than dead code:
  * no `.git` anywhere above us      -> not a repo, so no worktree can exist -> the local tree IS the
                                        project; a drop-in with no north-star reads `absent`, not a nag
  * `.git` is a DIRECTORY            -> an ordinary checkout, never a linked worktree -> same
  * `.git` is a FILE                 -> a linked worktree or submodule, and the one thing that could
                                        say where the real tree is just failed -> `unreachable`

Host-agnostic (`git` + stdlib, no hooks), zero deps, ASCII output.
