status transitions are recorded, behind four ops: next_pending / mark_in_progress / complete / park.

- LocalSource  — goal markdown files under .sdlc/goals/ (zero-dep; the default).
- GitHubSource — open GitHub issues labelled `sdlc:goal`, via the `gh` CLI. Status maps to labels:
  in-progress -> add `sdlc:in-progress`; done -> close the issue; parked -> add `sdlc:parked` + a

    primitive every graphql-search-billed `gh issue list --label ...` (or bare `--search`) call
    site in this kit migrates to. `GitHubSource._fetch_issues_rest` below is a thin wrapper over
    this exact function, bound to one instance's `self._run`/`self.repo`; `mirror.py`, `triage.py`
    and `status.py` call it directly with their OWN injectable `run` and configured `repo`, since
    none of them has (or should acquire) a `GitHubSource` instance just to reach this.

    ANDs `labels` (comma-joined — GitHub REST's own AND semantics, verified live identical to
    repeated `--label` flags on the `gh issue list` this replaces) onto the query when `labels` is
    non-empty, and omits the field entirely when it is — sending `labels=` as an empty string is
    NOT the same query to GitHub as sending no `labels=` field at all, and an unscoped caller
    (`triage.py`'s campaign survey, which filters by nothing but state/assignee) needs the latter.
    `state`/`sort`/`direction` are REST parameters native to this endpoint, so no `--search
    "sort:X"` qualifier (itself always graphql-search-billed, label or no label — it IS the search
    field, by construction) is ever needed for ordering OR for state.

    WHY NOT `gh issue list` (what this replaces): ANY `--label` flag makes `gh` route the call
    through GitHub's `search()` GraphQL field regardless of whether `--search` is also given
    (confirmed live with `GH_DEBUG=api` — see `.sdlc/research/1829-rest-backlog-pick.md`), billed
    against the shared 5000/hour `graphql` resource at ~2600+ points per call. This REST call is
    confirmed billed against the separate `core` resource instead, at ~1 point.

    MUST pass `--method GET` explicitly on every call: `gh api` defaults to POST the instant any
    `-f` field is given (verified live against a real, safe GET-only endpoint) — omitting this
    against a real issues-list endpoint would attempt to CREATE an issue.

    REPO RESOLUTION: an empty/falsy `repo` uses the literal `{owner}/{repo}` placeholder, which
    `gh api` resolves from the working directory's git remote at zero extra requests (confirmed
    live) — the same meaning an unset `--repo` already carried for `gh issue list`.

    Filters any item carrying a `pull_request` key: REST's issues-list endpoint returns PRs too
    (GitHub represents a PR as an issue for this endpoint); the graphql `search()` query this
    replaces always carried an implicit `type:issue` qualifier that excluded them (confirmed
    live). Uses the PRE-filter page length to decide whether to fetch another page, so a page that
    happens to be mostly PRs can never look short and truncate pagination early.

    `per_page` IS FIXED FOR THE WHOLE CALL, computed once from `cap` before the loop starts — see
    `GitHubSource._fetch_issues_rest`'s own docstring (this note predates the #1833 extraction and
    still names the exact live-reproduced bug this guards against) for why recomputing it from the
    FILTERED count silently re-indexes into the wrong raw offset the moment one page contains a
    filtered item.

    Raises on the first transport failure or unparseable response — does not retry internally.
    Retrying (when a caller wants it) is that caller's own concern, exactly as it was before this

    ONE `gh issue view --json comments` call. Read-only, injectable `run` (default `_run_gh`) for
    hermetic tests -- same DI contract as every other GitHub read in this file. FAIL-OPEN: any error
    (not `gh`, no auth, bad `goal` ref, network blip, malformed JSON) returns [] rather than raising.
    This sits on a hot path (backlog_check.precheck's pre-token check) and will sit on a periodic one
    too (a future watch tick) — neither may ever stall or crash because a comment fetch failed.

    Body text is NOT scrubbed here. Scrubbing is caller-specific (e.g. backlog_check.py calls
    scrub.scrub() explicitly, mirroring how it already scrubs title/body) — a third, silent scrub
    pass here would be a scrub callers can't see and can't reason about, which is worse than none.

    `id` is GitHub's GraphQL node id (e.g. `IC_kwDOTE1deM8AAAABNe8Wcg`) — opaque, NOT a sortable
    integer (verified live against a real repo: `gh issue view <n> --json comments`). Ordering for
    "new vs. seen" is therefore by `created_at` (ISO-8601, always present, string-sortable); identity
    for "have I seen this before" is by `id` (a dedup key only, never assumed orderable).

    Known, explicit cost caveat: `gh issue view --json comments` has no server-side comment-count
    limit flag (confirmed via `gh issue view --help` — only `-c/--comments` to toggle inclusion, no
    count). `limit` bounds what THIS FUNCTION returns and callers process, not the underlying
    network/GraphQL cost of the one `gh` call itself — for the overwhelming majority of SDLC goal
    issues (single digits to low dozens of comments) this is a non-issue; an issue with
    hundreds/thousands of comments would make this one call slow. Not solved here (no `gh` flag
    exists to solve it); documented so nobody mistakes `limit` for a request-size cap.

        `docs/branching-model.md` §14 states this as the contract; §4/§4c are the declaration pair

        CASE-INSENSITIVE, for the reason `feature_labels.is_feature_label` already gives: GitHub

        #1468: it is ALSO where `gh label create <feature:*>` is refused. A feature label is created
        BY A HUMAN, never by Sigma: attaching one is additive and reversible, while creating one
        mutates the repository's namespace permanently and a typo in a body marker would mint junk
        that outlives the unit (`docs/label-model.md` §5's flagged tier).

        WHICH CALL SITE MAKES THE CHOKEPOINT LOAD-BEARING -- corrected, because the first version of
        this paragraph named the wrong one. There are three `gh label create` sites: `_ensure_labels`
        and `create_dependency` here, and `triage._ensure_arbitrary_labels`, which lives in ANOTHER
        MODULE and reaches for this method itself. A per-call-site rule would have covered the first
        two, so `create_dependency` does NOT justify the placement -- the triage site does, because a
        guard written into this file alone would leak there silently. (`create_dependency` is still
        where this matters TODAY rather than only under L3: `handoff.py` passes a free-text `--label`
        list straight into its per-label create loop, so `handoff track --label feature:voice` reaches
        it right now.)

        THE GUARANTEE IS CLI-VERB-SHAPED, and the bound is written down so nobody reads it wider than
        it is. What is refused is the `label create` verb. `gh label clone` (which copies EVERY label
        of another repo), `gh label edit --name`, a delete-and-recreate, and the REST form
        `gh api -X POST repos/{owner}/{repo}/labels` all still mint labels and are NOT covered. None
        appears anywhere in this tree today.

        THE REFUSAL LEAVES NO DURABLE TRACE, and that is accepted rather than overlooked: this
        method has no `sdlc_dir`, and threading one through the hottest path in the class for a
        diagnostic is not worth it while the single reachable path today (`create_dependency`, via
        `handoff`) already fails loudly with a non-zero exit a human sees. Follow-up: **#1508** --
        it matters once L3 stamping runs the same path autonomously, where a loud interactive
        failure becomes a silent unattended one.

        A SILENT no-op (plus one stderr line), not a raise: every `label create` call site in this
        codebase already discards the return inside its own `try/except: pass`, so raising would be
        swallowed and tell nobody. Note what the return value means -- a create `gh` REJECTS raises
        (`_run_gh`), so `""` is the SUCCESS shape, and a refusal is therefore indistinguishable from
        having created the label, not from having failed to. Nothing downstream is broken by that: an
        `issue create --label feature:x` against a repo with no such label fails loudly, which is the

    # with 7 bad end states, 5 of which are label sets the state machine cannot even name -- including
    # `{}` (zero-label limbo), which no label query anywhere can return, so nothing can ever find it
    # again. 17 such illegal states are reachable across the 7 transitions; live census found 126 of
    # 605 managed sigma issues (20.8 per 100) sitting in one.
    #
    # This collapses each transition to ONE mutation request. Verified live against scratch issue
    # #1390 before this was written:
    #   - `gh issue edit --add-label X --remove-label Y` is FOUR HTTP requests, and the remove and add
    #     are dispatched 0.67ms apart IN PARALLEL -- so the intermediate state is non-deterministic
    #     (the issue can transiently carry both labels or neither, and which is undefined).
    #   - The REST alternative (`PUT /issues/{n}/labels`) is one request but REPLACES the whole set,
    #     forcing a read-modify-write with NO compare-and-swap available (If-Match and
    #     If-Unmodified-Since are both hard-rejected, HTTP 400). A real lost update was reproduced
    #     with it: a concurrent `bug` label silently destroyed, exposure window 1345-1842ms.
    #   - A single GraphQL document carrying two ALIASED root mutations is one request AND needs no
    #     read-modify-write, because `addLabelsToLabelable`/`removeLabelsFromLabelable` are
    #     server-side DELTAS. Verified: `priority:P4` survived a swap it was never sent in.
    #
    # HONEST LIMIT, stated because it matters: one request is not one TRANSACTION. GraphQL root
    # mutations execute serially and do NOT roll back -- a valid remove paired with an invalid add
    # leaves the remove COMMITTED (proved). Two things make that acceptable where today's shape is
    # not: the failure is REPORTED (non-zero exit, `errors[].path` naming the failed alias) instead of
    # silently swallowed, and ADD IS ALIASED FIRST so a partial application leaves BOTH lifecycle

        `LabelConnection` caps a page at 100 nodes, so on any repo carrying more than 100 labels --
        ordinary on a mature project, which is precisely the adopter this kit is aimed at -- the
        `sdlc:*` labels could simply not be in the window. `_swap_labels`' one-shot "a label created
        since the cache warmed" refresh could not rescue it either, because it re-ran the IDENTICAL
        unpaginated query. The swap then raised `unknown label(s) on this repo`,
        `_swap_labels_best_effort` swallowed it with one stderr line, and EVERY lifecycle transition
        silently stopped writing labels -- with `reconcile.py`'s repair path, which routes through
        this same primitive, equally dead. The release's governing property ("a park that cannot
        write its labels leaves the goal re-pickable, never invisible") would not have held for the
        class of adopter most likely to install it.

        Fetching BY NAME instead of paginating is the better of the two available fixes: cost is
        constant in the number of labels actually being written (one aliased query, at most once per
        distinct label per process) rather than linear in the repo's label count, and it cannot
        regress as a repo grows. `repository.label(name:)` returns null for a name that does not
        exist, which is exactly the signal `_swap_labels` needs.

        Only labels that were FOUND are cached, so a name that is missing today is re-queried on the
        next call -- which is what makes a label created mid-run (by `_ensure_labels` on a fresh
        repo) self-healing, without the cache-invalidation dance this used to need."""

    def _assignee_login(self):
        """The LOGIN to match issue assignees against, or None to skip the check entirely.

        Two things make this more than `return self.assignee`:

        `@me` is a `gh` SERVER-SIDE alias, not a login. It is the documented value (and what this
        kit's own template suggests), so comparing it literally against `assignees[].login` would
        match nothing and filter the ENTIRE backlog away -- turning a defense-in-depth check into a
        total outage of the picker. It is resolved once, via the authenticated user, and cached.

        FAILS OPEN, deliberately. If the login cannot be resolved (offline, auth expired), this
        returns None and a caller's client-side check is skipped rather than excluding everything
        -- whereas failing closed would stop every pick on a transient error.

        WHAT "FAILS OPEN" COSTS DIFFERS BY CALLER -- stale claim corrected by #1829's own
        post-implementation review, so spelled out here rather than asserted once and left to rot
        again. `_board_queue` passes the RAW `self.assignee` value straight into the board query's
        own `assignee:` qualifier -- GitHub resolves `@me` server-side there, with NO dependency on
        this method succeeding, so a resolution failure costs that caller ONLY its client-side
        cross-check; the query-level scope is untouched, exactly as this docstring used to claim
        for every caller. `_fetch_pending` (#1829) cannot make that claim: REST's `assignee=`
        query param does not understand the literal string `"@me"` at all (a hard 422 from the
        live API, confirmed) -- that caller has no choice but to feed this method's resolved value
        into the query itself, so a resolution failure there costs the query's own scope too, not
        just the client-side check. #1829 narrows that exposure by re-resolving once PER RETRY
        ATTEMPT rather than once for the whole call (see that call site), but cannot remove it --
        REST has no `"@me"` of its own to fall back on the way the old `--assignee` CLI flag did.

        A FAILURE IS NOT CACHED. Only a successful resolution is. Failing open on one call is a
        defensible trade; making that failure sticky and silent is not -- a long-running loop that
        blipped once at startup would then run its entire session unguarded. So a failure is
        retried on the next call (by either caller) and announced once, matching this module's
        existing loud-on-degraded convention."""

        design (a caller must be able to know a lifecycle write failed), but the transitions that
        call it CANNOT propagate that:

          - `_offboard` IS the park path. `run_loop`'s #335 handler and `_record`'s #1201 handler
            both downgrade an exception into a park — so a raising park would be asked to park
            again, and the plan review flagged that as the most likely place in this whole change
            for a real bug.
          - `mark_in_progress` raising would stop a goal being picked at all, for a label the
            docstring itself calls best-effort visibility.
          - `complete` raising would lose the terminal record for a goal that genuinely finished
            (exactly the #1201 regression).

        So: swallow, but LOUDLY — one stderr line naming the goal, the transition and the error.
        Today's call sites swallow silently and in triplicate; this is strictly more informative
        while preserving the fail-open contract every one of them documents. Returns whether the

    # #1829 moved this fetch to a real REST endpoint (`_fetch_issues_rest`, below) specifically

    # call, not because of this consistency concern — REST's plain issues listing is generally
    # understood to read live repository state rather than an async search index, but this task
    # found no way to disprove the old lag applies to it too without risking a side effect against
    # a real, shared, concurrently-used production repo (creating a scratch issue to race a read
    # against it). So the retry below stays exactly as it was: it is cheap on the (overwhelmingly
    # common) genuinely-drained path regardless of which of the two reasons applies, and it is

        picked carries none yet (`_issue_in_feature`'s own docstring states the identical fact for
        the identical reason) and resolves `discovery.UNPRIORITISED` here -- sorting as if it

        rather than merely unlikely (the label era relied on the ledger claim to avoid re-picking
        in-flight work). An issue with NO card falls back to its label — the forgiving direction, so
        a goal filed but never carded cannot silently vanish; `_sync_backlog` cards it as `Ready` on
        the next board touch. Ready cards come first, in board order; uncarded labelled issues
        follow, in priority order.

        Everything else — no board, no `Ready` option, `queue_source: "label"`, or any board read
        that fails — uses the historical label queue unchanged.

        #1837: the two calls into the label machinery below carry OPPOSITE `primary` values on
        purpose. `_first_by_label` below (no board at all) IS the picker, so it fails closed on a
        persistent, configured-assignee resolution failure. The uncarded-safety-net call
        (`primary=False`) stays fail-open — the board's own Ready lane is the real ownership
        boundary in that mode, and this fallback only ever adds to what the Ready lane already
        found, never replaces it.

        #1661: A `--feature` RUN READS THE LABEL QUEUE, whatever `queue_source` says, and the
        trade is deliberate. Membership is the DECLARATION (`docs/branching-model.md` §14, and

        BODY — so the board simply cannot see whether an unlabelled card belongs to the unit, and a
        board-ordered scoped run would skip every member that has not been picked before. Losing

        issue, regardless of priority tier. Reuses `_fetch_pending` completely UNCHANGED with an
        extra `--label blocking_label` filter — `gh issue list --label` ANDs repeated flags, so this
        is naturally scoped to issues carrying BOTH labels, and it inherits every existing safeguard
        for free: the retry/degraded-read machinery, the parked/in-progress/blocked exclusion, and
        `_pick_key` sorting for the tie-break AMONG multiple simultaneously-blocking issues (priority,
        then bug, then oldest-first — unaffected by this override, which only decides the FIRST
        split, never the ordering within it).

        Deliberately its OWN separate query rather than a change to `_pick_key`'s sort tuple or the
        tier-widening loop below: `_pick_key`'s `(priority, not_a_bug, number)` shape and the
        widening loop's `tier_rank >= best_rank` arithmetic are both built around priority tiers
        specifically (and have their own history of subtle bugs — #813/#815/#854/#861 all live
        here) — threading a second, priority-independent dimension through that machinery would risk
        the exact same bug class in a new place. A dedicated, narrowly-filtered query sidesteps the
        200-issue fetch-window problem entirely too: a real backlog realistically never has 200+
        SIMULTANEOUSLY blocking issues, so this query is never at risk of needing its own
        tier-widening equivalent.

        `None` on a genuine read failure (mirrors `_fetch_pending`'s own `(0, None)` sentinel) — the
        caller (`_pending_by_label`) treats a failed OR genuinely-empty check identically, both
        falling through to the unmodified, normal priority-tier pool.

        Gated on `self.order == "priority"` (#1352 review finding, notable): `order: "created"`'s

        one definition governs both backends. An issue carrying SEVERAL priority labels ranks by the
        most urgent — not hypothetical, issue #381 on this repo carries both `priority:P0` and
        `priority:P1`. Absent or unrecognised ranks last, which is what makes a backlog that uses no
        priority labels at all sort exactly as it did before (#698).

        #2262 (D-3 of `.sdlc/design/2253.md`): `feature_rank` sits immediately after `priority_rank`
        — a LEXICOGRAPHIC tuple, never a weighted sum, because "never a replacement for issue
        priority" has to be structural: a P0 bug in any unit still outranks every P1, no matter how
        the unit-priority term compares, purely because Python tuple comparison never even looks at
        position 2 until position 0 and 1 both tie. See `_feature_rank`'s own docstring for what it
        resolves to and when.

        #813: bare issue number was the ONLY tie-break within a tier — strictly oldest-first. Two
        issues sharing a priority tier are common (P0 is rarely used; most real backlogs cluster in
        P1-P2), and oldest-first among THOSE has no relationship to severity: an older tech-debt or
        enhancement goal in the same tier as a newer production bug outranked it purely by filing
        date. `bug` is an EXISTING, already-asserted label (not a new taxonomy this introduces) —
        within one priority tier, a bug-labeled issue now sorts ahead of a non-bug one; issue number
        remains the tie-break within THAT split, so two bugs (or two non-bugs) in the same tier still
        resolve oldest-first exactly as before.

        NOTE, and it is a real limitation: this reorders only WITHIN the fetched page. `next_pending`
        asks for the 200 OLDEST matching issues (`sort:created-asc --limit 200`), so on a backlog
        deeper than that a recently-filed P0 stays invisible until older goals drain. That predates
        this change — under strict oldest-first the window was harmless, because the minimum of the
        oldest 200 IS the global minimum; it stops being harmless the moment the key is no longer
        the same one the server sorted by. Reading the board directly (#693) removes the window."""

        mark_in_progress, replacing the manual `gh issue edit --remove-label` + hand-written
        comment this repo's own operator had to do on #813/#815/#817/#821 before this verb
        existed. `next`/`next-batch` claim a goal via mark_in_progress as part of picking it; if
        the caller then never calls `complete`/`park`/`fail` on that SAME goal (next-batch picked
        more than got dispatched this run, or a later pick was `--skip`ped after an earlier one
        already claimed it), nothing ever undoes that claim. This does: remove the in-progress
        label, leave an audit-trail comment, and put the board card back in the Ready lane —
        WITHOUT touching the goal label, the parked label, or closing the issue. The goal is not
        done and not blocked on a human decision; it is, once again, an ordinary pending goal.

        Mirrors mark_in_progress's own label call and _offboard's own comment call exactly: each
        `gh` call individually try/excepted, so a transient error on any one of them can never
        raise into the caller or leave the goal half-released.

        POST-REVIEW FIX (PR #1107, Finding 3): refuses — a clean, SILENT no-op, no `gh` mutation
        at all — when the issue is already done (CLOSED) or parked/failed (carries
        `parked_label`; #506's `_offboard` gives both the same label, distinguished only by
        comment text, so one label check covers both). Pre-fix this fired unconditionally:
        reproduced live, calling release on a never-claimed/already-terminal issue still removed
        the in-progress label and posted the "claimed but not started" comment regardless. The
        probe (`issue view --json state,labels`) mirrors `complete()`'s own already-CLOSED probe
        (#505) — same fail-OPEN posture on a transient `gh` error: a probe failure falls through
        to the pre-fix release behavior rather than blocking a legitimate one, since no per-field
        bound can tell a real transient error from a genuine terminal state here. Returns True
        when it actually released the claim, False for the no-op.

        #1121 (follow-up from #841's own review), DELIBERATELY NOT DISTINGUISHED, DOCUMENTED
        INSTEAD: a nonexistent/deleted issue and a genuine release both return True here. The probe
        above raises on a bad issue number exactly the same way it raises on a transient network
        error (both are a bare `Exception` from `_run`/`json.loads`, with no structured
        exit-code/stderr distinction surfaced by `_run` to tell them apart), so it falls into the
        SAME `except Exception: pass` the transient-error case above already relies on — `terminal`
        stays `False`, and every call below (`--remove-label`, the audit comment, the board-status
        move) fires anyway, each already its own best-effort `try/except`. On a genuinely deleted
        issue this yields three individually-harmless no-op `gh` failures (an already-nonexistent
        issue cannot un-relabel, comment, or move) followed by an honest `return True`; on a
        genuine release it is the intended path. Left this way on purpose, not merely unnoticed:
        every other GitHub-side operation in this class (`complete()`'s own already-CLOSED probe,
        #505; the terminal-state probe just above) is fail-open/best-effort by the same design, and
        a deleted issue is already unpickable (`source.fetch_pending`/`mark_in_progress` both
        require a resolvable issue number before a claim can exist in the first place), so the
        window this could matter in — the issue existed long enough to be claimed, then vanished
        before `release` ran — is narrow, and the WORST case is one duplicate no-op `gh` attempt on
        an id that no longer resolves to anything, not a silently wrong ledger/board state.
        Genuinely telling the two apart would mean `_run` surfacing exit code/stderr to every
        caller (a wider, cross-cutting change touching every method in this class, not a local
        one) for a distinction whose only consumer today would be a caller that wants to log
        "released" vs "was already gone" — no such caller exists. Left as a smaller, separately-

        identical reason -- `agrim-goal-review`'s REJECT verdict writes NOTHING else (§7g: no label,
        no board move, no edit to the issue body), so this one comment is the ENTIRE record of a
        rejection, and a transient `gh` hiccup at exactly this moment (an active-account drift on a
        host juggling more than one `gh` login is one well-documented cause) must not be free to
        erase it. RAISES on final failure, deliberately unlike the old shape here: `loop.py`'s
        `note` CLI verb is what decides whether a failed note is fatal to the caller, and it cannot
        decide what it is never told -- this method used to be reached through a silent
        `try/except: pass` one layer up (loop.py's `note` verb, before #1986).

        A retry that turns out to have followed an actually-landed write double-posts the comment.
        Accepted, deliberately: for an audit trail that is otherwise all-or-nothing, a duplicate
        REJECT comment is a categorically safer failure than a silently missing one.

        #1657: `gh issue comment` resolves through GraphQL, whose 5,000-points/hour budget is
        shared with every other `gh`-based operation on this board (project/board writes, `gh
        issue view --json`, ...) and was confirmed exhausted for real during #1514 (a session
        heavy on `gh` calls). Retrying the SAME call against an exhausted hourly quota just
        re-fails `_NOTE_RETRIES` times in a few seconds and then raises -- the comment, which for
        a REJECT verdict is §7g's ENTIRE record, is lost. Once every GraphQL attempt above has
        come back transient, fall back ONCE to `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{n}/comments`
        (REST v3), which draws on a completely separate 5,000/hour budget -- the same reasoning
        a downstream goal-cost recorder already documents for its own comment mirror, and
        confirmed live in #1514: REST kept working the entire time GraphQL read exhausted. A
        non-transient GraphQL failure (bad auth, issue not found, ...) still raises immediately,
        exactly as before -- REST would fail the same way and for the same reason, so trying it
        would only spend a second quota to learn nothing new.

        POST-MERGE REVIEW FIX: REPO RESOLUTION deliberately does NOT use `self._owner_name()`,
        for the identical reason `_fetch_issues_rest` (above) already documents for itself --
        that helper's unset-`repo` fallback shells out to `gh repo view --json owner,name`, which
        is ITSELF graphql-billed. `discovery.github.repo` ships EMPTY in the agrim-init template
        and `/agrim-setup` explicitly supports leaving it unset, so calling `_owner_name()` here
        would resolve straight back onto the exhausted GraphQL quota this fallback exists to route
        around -- reproduced by a fake-`gh` test with `repo` unset: the ORIGINAL fix's
        `_owner_name()` call shelled out to `gh repo view`, hit the same simulated rate limit, and
        the comment was lost exactly as before this fallback existed (see
        `test_github_note_with_no_resolvable_repo_still_falls_back_to_rest` below). Mirroring
        `_fetch_issues_rest` exactly: when `self.repo` is set, address it directly
        (`repos/<repo>/issues/<n>/comments`); when unset, use the literal `{owner}/{repo}`
        placeholder, which `gh api` resolves from the working directory's git remote at ZERO extra
        requests (confirmed live by `_fetch_issues_rest`'s own docstring) -- no network call, no
        quota touched, so an unset `repo` can never again defeat this fallback. A REST call that
        itself fails (genuinely no git remote to infer from, bad auth, ...) raises that failure

        picked up by that person's OWN loop through the `assignee` filter, so a hand-off routes itself
        over the backlog the team already shares — no new transport and no daemon. This is the only
        place the kit ever SETS an assignee, and it is the point: parking told nobody, this tells

        PRESERVING the ids of the options already there. The gh CLI has no field-edit, so this is
        how the built-in Status field gets our columns.

        Preserving ids is not a nicety (#720). An ID-LESS rewrite DELETES and recreates every
        option, and GitHub then disables any built-in workflow that pointed at one. Measured on a
        throwaway project: a fresh board has all six workflows ENABLED, and an id-less rewrite turns
        five of them off — including `Item closed`, the workflow that moves a card to Done when its
        issue closes. That is the mechanism behind the 92 stranded cards on this repo's own board,
        and behind the five epic cards that had no Status at all. It is the same failure that wipes
        card values (`board_migrate.py`'s rehearsal step [3]); it just costs workflows too.

        Matching, in order:
          1. a desired name that an existing option already has, EXACTLY or differing only by
             case  -> reuse that id, and keep the EXISTING spelling rather than ours. GitHub's own
             defaults are `In progress` (lowercase p); a caller asking for `In Progress` used to
             miss this and every later rule, landing on rule 3 and creating a genuine duplicate
             lane every time setup ran (#1492). A case-only difference is a claim, never a rename —
             renaming stays exclusive to rule 2, the only rule allowed to change what a human sees.
          2. a desired name listed in `rename` as the new name of an existing option -> reuse that
             option's id, so GitHub's default `Todo` becomes our `Backlog` rather than being
             deleted alongside its workflows;
          3. anything else                                       -> a genuinely new option, no id;
          4. any existing option we never claimed                -> KEPT under its own name. Never
             delete or repurpose a lane somebody added.

        `rename` is deliberately an EXPLICIT map rather than pairing leftovers in order. An earlier
        version paired positionally and quietly renamed an adopter's `Needs design` lane to `Ready`
        — which, now that Status is the queue, would have enqueued every card sitting in it. A
        rename is only ever safe when the caller can name both sides, and the only caller that can
        is the fresh-board path, where GitHub itself created the options we are replacing.

        `existing` defaults to empty, which reproduces the historical all-id-less output exactly —
        so a caller that has not read the field yet is no worse off than before.

        Colour and description (#235, review of PR #279): an existing option that carries a valid
        `color` and a `description` is sent back WITH them, so a rewrite never recolours or blanks
        a lane a human styled. Only a new option, or an existing one read without them (`gh project
        field-list` returns just id + name), gets the colour-by-position and an empty description.

        Every interpolated value -- field id, option id, name, description -- is a JSON-quoted
        GraphQL string literal (JSON's escapes are a subset GraphQL accepts), never pasted raw: a
        human's lane named `Needs "design"` otherwise ends the string and breaks the mutation."""

        """Opt-in blocker priority promotion (#900): when `discovery.blocker_promotion.mode` is
        "smart" or "always", a blocker's priority is raised to match the urgency of what it blocks.
        Today the loop only PARKS the blocked issue and never touches the blocker's own priority,
        so a P2 blocker sitting behind a P0 can sit at P2 forever. Runs once per open `sdlc:goal`
        issue, on every board touch, from `_sync_backlog` — the same cadence `_mirror_priority`
        already runs at, over the exact same fetched `issues` (`_sync_backlog` only requests the
        `title`/`body` this needs when this mode is not "off" to begin with — see its docstring).

        Gated FIRST on `self.blocker_promotion_mode != "off"` so an adopter who never sets this key
        pays NOTHING beyond that one already-cheap attribute check: no ledger read, no regex scan,
        no extra `gh` call.

        REVERSE LOOKUP (given a blocker, what does it directly block?) — two independent, additive
        channels, mirroring backlog_check.py's own `_explicit_blockers()` + ledger-hand-off split
        for the FORWARD question ("what blocks THIS goal"):
          1. EXPLICIT: `backlog_check._BLOCK_RE`, read LIVE off the module every call (via
             `_get_backlog_check()` — never copied into a local pattern, so a monkeypatch of the
             real regex is observable, the same live-attribute-read contract `triage.py`'s
             `_scan_block_edges` already relies on), over each issue's own title+body — the exact
             haystack shape and precision rule (the referenced issue must be a real OPEN member of
             this corpus, never the referencing issue itself) as `_explicit_blockers()` /
             `_scan_block_edges()`.
          2. LEDGER: `ledger.outstanding()` hand-off entries — the entry's `goal` is the blocked
             issue, `ledger.handoff_key()` (its `issue` field, falling back to `goal`) is the
             blocker. This channel is what SURVIVES a park that strips `sdlc:goal` from the blocked
             issue (a ledger entry is a local file, independent of GitHub label state) — the
             explicit channel alone cannot see that case: `_sync_backlog`'s own corpus is
             `--state open --label sdlc:goal`, so a blocked issue already parked for exactly this
             reason has already lost the label this whole scan depends on to see it at all. Needs
             `self.sdlc_dir` (optional, #900) — absent (every pre-#900 construction site), this
             channel is silently unavailable and the explicit channel alone still works.
        Both channels are restricted to blockers that are THEMSELVES members of this corpus:
        promoting a blocker means reading its current label / rank / board item, which this pass
        only has on hand for issues `_sync_backlog` already fetched — anything else would cost
        additional `gh` calls this mechanism has no budget for. The blocked side of an edge is
        restricted the same way, for the same reason: computing "has other unblocked work at its
        tier" needs that issue's own rank too.

        TRANSITIVE WALK: if C blocks B blocks A, C must ALSO promote — `resolve()` below calls
        `discovery.blocker_promotion_rank` once per edge, walking from the most-blocked end
        inward, feeding one level's PROMOTED (not original) rank in as the next level's `own_rank`,
        exactly as s0's own docstring documents and its own test proves composes correctly.
        Guarded against a cycle in the (hand-authored, so never fully trusted) blocking graph: a
        back-edge into a node still being resolved is broken by treating it as contributing no
        further promotion pressure (that node's own current rank, not a re-entrant call), and every
        cycle-involved ref is reported once via stderr — detected and neutralised, never a hang or
        a crash.

        WRITE: performed through the exact same mechanism `_mirror_priority` itself writes through
        (`_write_priority_label` / `_write_priority_field`) — never a second, parallel write path.
        Every write is paired with an issue comment naming the cause (`_write_blocker_promotion`);
        never a silent label change. A promotion can only ever raise a blocker's urgency, never
        lower it (`discovery.blocker_promotion_rank`'s own `min()` guarantees this), so a blocker

        making the one DANGEROUS partial outcome loud and specific instead of indistinguishable

        scope-gated `_note_scope`, which for a non-scope error prints nothing at all -- so nothing

        comment ("Parked -- needs review") is true regardless of which earlier label edit landed,
        but THIS comment is itself a factual claim ("priority promoted X -> Y") -- posting it after
        a label write that never actually happened would assert a change that didn't occur, which
        is worse than the silence #900 already accepts as unavoidable for an ordinary failure. So a
        failed label write is reported once (`_note_scope`, matching every other board write's
        fail-open convention in this class) and nothing further is attempted for this blocker --
        byte-identical to this method's own pre-split behavior for that specific case. The field

        Three cases, and only the first two write anything — a board already in agreement costs
        nothing, which is what makes this safe to run on every sync:

        * field RECOGNISED, label disagrees  -> the LABEL is corrected, always to the CANONICAL
          `priority:P<n>` spelling — never the field's own text, alias or not, so a label never
          carries anything but the one vocabulary every other reader (issue search, `handoff.py`,
          local-goals mode) already understands. The field is what the queue ranks by, so leaving
          the label stale would make all of those disagree with the order work actually runs in.
        * field BLANK (not just unrecognised — see below), label recognised -> the FIELD is filled,
          preferring a literal `P<n>` option and falling back to a configured alias' own option
          (`_option_for_rank`) when the field doesn't offer P0-P4 at all.
        * neither recognised, or they already agree -> nothing.

        "Recognised" runs the raw text through `discovery.priority_rank` WITH `self.priority_aliases`
        for the field side (so `Critical` counts as P0 once an adopter configures that), and without
        aliases for the label side (`_priority_name` already resolved any alias in the label itself,
        so its return value is always a canonical `P0`-`P4` string or None).

        This distinction — recognised vs merely non-blank — is the actual correctness fix, aliases
        configured or not: the field previously won on ANY non-blank text, so a stray value left over
        from before sigma managed the field (a typo, unrelated text, an adopter's own vocabulary
        nobody told sigma about yet) silently overwrote a genuinely correct label with something
        `priority_rank` then couldn't parse, sinking a real priority to UNPRIORITISED. An unrecognised
        field value is now treated exactly like a blank one would be for the "does the field object"
        question — but NOT filled from the label either (that's still gated on truly blank), since a

        value on the card is now `token`.

        `vocabulary` is [(token, colour)] from `phase_report.PHASE_TOKENS` -- passed in, never copied
        here, so the board's options and the output contract cannot say different things.

        Gated: a no-op with ZERO gh calls unless `project.enabled` and a `project.number` is pinned

        ONE read (`_read_card`: this issue's card on the pinned board, by repository and number) and
        at most one write per field; a card whose Phase already reads `token` costs no write at all.
        No repo link, no backlog sync, no board creation, no whole-board item list.

        Phase is Sigma's own column: absent, it is created ONCE (single-select, fixed options) on the
        pinned board. Priority is created only where the field is Sigma's (`_priority_owned`); on
        anyone else's board it is mirrored label -> field into an existing column only, and a blank
        one only, and a label is never rewritten from it. A field is matched by `_match_field`
        (exact, else one case-only variant); its options exactly, then by case, and a missing one is
        NEVER appended (the loop cannot read option colours, and #235's rule is to refuse rather than
        reset them). Nothing is renamed, recoloured, reordered or dropped. Status is never written

    THE ONE ENTRY POINT. `GitHubSource.scope_to_feature` is the mechanism; this is where the two
    ways of asking for something impossible are refused, UP FRONT, before a single query is made.

    THE NAME IS CHECKED BY `features._is_unit_name`, NOT BY A SECOND COPY OF THE RULE. That
    predicate is the one `features.parse_body` and `features.parse_labels` already apply, and it is
    what `feature_registry.is_unit_name` re-exports for the same reason: a unit name becomes BOTH a
    `feature:<name>` label and a `feature/<name>` branch segment, so it has to be a name git accepts
    (measured against `git check-ref-format` in `features.py`'s own rule 4 -- no `..`, no trailing
    `.`, no `.lock` suffix, no `/`). A local copy here would be free to drift, and a name this
    accepted but the parser rejected would scope a run to a label no issue can ever carry.

    REFUSED, NOT SILENTLY MATCHED AGAINST NOTHING. `gh issue list --label <a label the repo does not
    have>` returns an empty list rather than an error (measured), so every failure of this kind
    looks exactly like a drained unit. A typo would therefore report "your unit is empty" and stop,
    which is the single most misleading thing this feature could do.

    A SOURCE WITH NO UNIT TO SCOPE TO IS REFUSED FOR THE SAME REASON. `LocalSource`'s goals are
    FILES: they carry no labels and there is no `feature:` namespace for them to sit in, so a
    `--feature` run against one would match zero goals forever. Duck-typed on the method rather than
    on the class, so a future source that CAN express units needs no change here."""
