"""Ledger-triggered wake-and-work: `autowatch.py tick <sdlc_dir> [--issue N]`.

Part of #1318 (the ledger-autowatch epic). This is the ONE shared decision core both eventual
adapters (a Desktop scheduled task, the CLI/Channels plugin — #1318's other child issues) call
identically, so the safety-critical logic that decides "is it safe to spend real tokens and touch
the worktree RIGHT NOW, unattended" exists exactly once. Neither adapter is wired here — this issue
(#1319) is the core script alone, callable directly via CLI for testing.

WHAT ONE TICK DOES, in order:
  1. `ledger.autowatch.enabled` gate. Not `true` (absent or `false`, matching every other opt-in
     feature's own convention) → no-op, exit 0. Nothing read, nothing written.
  2. Find the ONE thing to act on: `--issue N` names it directly, or this pulls the ledger and
     picks the oldest unactioned mention/assignment/blocker addressed to `me` (never more than one
     per tick — a later tick picks up the rest).
  3. Evaluate preconditions, in a fixed order, short-circuiting on the first failure:
     `require_gh_auth` → `no_concurrent_session` → `load_average_ceiling` →
     `spend_ceiling_tokens_per_week`.
  4. A hop-limit check on the candidate's own `autowatch_hop` chain (not one of the 4 preconditions
     above — a per-candidate cap, not an environment gate).
  5. Only if every check passes: drive `/agrim-loop` scoped to that ONE issue — never an
     open-ended backlog drain while nobody is watching.
  6. On every single outcome — success, any precondition block, hop-limit refusal, "nothing to
     do", or a genuine failure inside the driven run, INCLUDING an unhandled exception anywhere in
     this module — write one ledger note. `tick()` itself never raises; see its own docstring.

SCOPE → LEDGER KIND. The epic's `ledger.autowatch.scope` vocabulary (mentions/assignments/
blockers) is a human-facing description of ledger.py's own `to`-addressed kind space, not a third
ledger kind of its own: `ledger.py`'s KINDS has exactly two kinds a human answers — `handoff` (a
genuine cross-area BLOCKING dependency; see `handoff.py`'s own docstring) and `note` (everything
else addressed to someone: a same-area FYI, a non-blocking cross-area note, a plain mention).
`assignments` and `blockers` both resolve to kind="handoff" — the only addressed kind whose
resolution `ledger.py` already tracks via `outstanding()`/`unanswered()`; `mentions` resolves to
kind="note". See SCOPE_KINDS below.

"UNACKED", precisely. For a `handoff` candidate, "unacked" is `ledger.unanswered()` — nobody has
even replied (not `outstanding()`, which still counts a hand-off someone has already `accepted` or
`deferred`; once a human takes it, autowatch backs off). A `note` candidate has no ack concept in
`ledger.py` at all, so it needs its own dedup: autowatch's own outcome note is written with
`ref=<candidate's own ledger id>` and `state="resolved"` (an existing, validated `ledger.py`
STATES value, not a new one) whenever the drive reaches a genuine `done` OR `parked` terminal
state (see "REAL OUTCOME VERIFICATION" below — a park is a complete, correctly-escalated outcome
from autowatch's own perspective, not a failure), and a candidate whose id already has such a note
is never re-selected. A precondition BLOCK, a properly-recorded `failed` outcome, or a driven run
that never reached ANY recorded terminal state deliberately does NOT set `state="resolved"` —
those are retriable, so the same candidate is picked up again on a later tick once conditions
allow it (a `handoff` candidate is additionally, independently bounded by the real `ack` mechanism
the moment anyone — including the driven run's own goal work — answers it).

REAL OUTCOME VERIFICATION (#1332) — exit-code 0 is NOT proof of success. A real, live end-to-end
run against a genuine issue exited 0 after doing real research and posting a comment, but never
called `loop.py record` at all — no plan, no implementation, no PR. After every drive, this module
re-reads the ledger for a NEW `done`/`parked`/`failed` entry for the target goal (the one thing
`loop.py record` itself always writes) before deciding the outcome: `done` → success/resolved;
`parked` → also resolved (a real, correct escalation, not a failure); `failed` → NOT resolved,
retriable later; nothing found → NOT resolved, treated as `failed` with a note naming exactly this
failure mode, so the mention stays available rather than silently vanishing forever.

HOP LIMIT. `autowatch_hop` (ledger.py OPTIONAL_FIELDS, #1319) counts how many autowatch-triggered
`/agrim-loop` runs already precede a given ledger entry in an unattended chain. The incoming hop is
the higher of two numbers (#1334): the candidate's own `autowatch_hop` field (0 if absent — a
fresh, non-chained trigger, e.g. a hand-off filed by someone else's own goal work), and the
highest `autowatch_hop` autowatch itself has already recorded in one of ITS OWN outcome notes
against this exact candidate (`_prior_autowatch_hop`) — needed because a retriable outcome (a
precondition block, a genuine `failed`, or a driven run that never recorded anything) leaves the
candidate's own static field untouched, so re-reading only that field would hand back the same
hop forever and this cap would never trip on repeated retries of the SAME candidate. That number
plus one must not exceed `ledger.autowatch.hop_limit`, or this tick refuses instead of driving.
The incremented hop is threaded onto the driven subprocess's environment
(`SIGMA_AUTOWATCH_HOP`) so that ANY ledger entry the driven run's own goal work later files —
e.g. a fresh cross-area hand-off via handoff.py — automatically carries it too (ledger.py's own
`append()` fills the field from that env var when a caller doesn't pass one explicitly), closing
the loop with zero changes needed to any other script.

SPEND CEILING — READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING IT. `spend_ceiling_tokens_per_week` is checked against a
LOCAL, gitignored, append-only file (`.sdlc/state/autowatch-spend.json`, rolling 7-day window) that
records only what THIS machine's autowatch-driven runs themselves reported spending (parsed from
the driven `claude -p --output-format json` call's own `total_cost_usd`, converted to an estimated
token count via a rough, DELIBERATELY approximate blended $/token constant — see
`_estimate_tokens_from_cost`'s own docstring). It is a heuristic approximation of "recent autowatch
spend on this machine" and NOTHING MORE: it cannot see a human's own interactive usage, any other
surface's spend, or another machine's autowatch history, and it MUST NEVER be presented to a human
as a true balance or a real budget check.

PRECONDITIONS ARE SAFETY-CRITICAL, NOT ADVISORY. This drives real, unattended `/agrim-loop`
invocations in production use — every check here gets the same rigor as `loop.py`'s own dispatch
logic, because a bug here means unattended spend or a corrupted worktree with nobody watching. The
governing failure-direction rule, applied consistently: when a check CANNOT be answered (a probe
errors, a binary is missing, a value fails to parse), it fails CLOSED (block) — a false block costs
one skipped tick, retried automatically later; a false pass risks exactly the harm this issue exists
to prevent. Zero deps beyond the stdlib.

    covered: a descendant that calls setsid itself; the sentinel itself being SIGKILLed; this
    process dying by SIGKILL in the instant between the model's spawn and the sentinel learning its
    group id, or between a normal finish and `done` (the sentinel then sweeps the finished model's
    group -- its leftovers, or nobody); a drive on a non-main thread, where nothing is trapped and
    a signal reaches the caller's own handling (the lifeline is the backstop if the process dies);
    a caller thread that has SIGTERM blocked, whose mask the model inherits, so the graceful step
    is lost and the model is SIGKILLed after the grace; a non-main-thread drive in a caller with
    SIGPIPE at SIG_DFL whose sentinel has already died (the main thread ignores SIGPIPE for the
    drive; a worker thread cannot). Repeats of one signal are re-delivered
    once. On a host without
    POSIX process groups (Windows) the call REFUSES -- `(2, NO_PROCESS_GROUP_REFUSAL)`, the same
    line on stderr, nothing spawned -- rather than proceed with a kill that cannot reach the tree.
    A sentinel that cannot be started is likewise a refusal to drive (exit 1).

    `on_spawn(pid)` (#2338, Component H's round-2 REJECT fix) is an OPTIONAL, additive, backward-
    compatible callback invoked the INSTANT the child process exists — before anything blocks
    waiting for it to finish, and before any timeout has a chance to fire. Every existing caller
    (`_drive`'s own autowatch tick) omits it. This exists so a caller that dispatches a driven
    session unattended (the Slack-commands listener, #2338) can register a REAL liveness marker for
    the CHILD's own pid (also its process-group id) — not just its own, short-lived, calling
