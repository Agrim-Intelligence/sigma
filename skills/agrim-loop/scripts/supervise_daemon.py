"""Overnight supervisor — OWNS the loop's lifetime so limit exhaustion never means
permanent downtime, with ZERO polling: this process is blocked (0 CPU) while the
session runs and asleep otherwise. On each session exit the classifier
(`supervise_classify.py`) reads the output tail and picks one of four verdicts:
done -> exit · relaunch/sleep -> short pause (or sleep until a stated usage-limit
reset) then relaunch, attempt counter reset · backoff -> capped escalating pause,
attempt counter climbs. Stop it any time: touch <sdlc>/state/supervisor.stop

macOS laptop note: a sleeping MACHINE stops everything — run under `caffeinate -is`
(or keep the device on AC with sleep off); OS one-shot wake timers are the
hardened alternative for sleep-prone machines.

    supervise_daemon.py [sdlc_dir]      (default .sdlc)

Env:
  SIGMA_CLAUDE_CMD          — the session command (default: claude -p /agrim-loop).
  SIGMA_SUPERVISE_MAX_RUNS  — total session launches before giving up (default 48).
  SIGMA_SUPERVISE_SLEEP_SCALE — multiply every wait (tests set a small fraction,
                                    e.g. 0.01, to shrink real pauses to a few seconds;
                                    default 1). A FLOAT here, unlike the bash original,
                                    which only ever accepted a bash integer.
  SIGMA_RUN_ID              — pre-set by an outer launcher to pin the run-id (see
                                    the #498 rationale below); left unset, this daemon
                                    generates one.

This is a straight port of `supervise.sh` (bash) to pure Python — same state files,
same stdout/log routing, same exit codes on the three paths bash had, same anchored
`sleep=` extraction contract. Three deliberate divergences from byte-parity, each
documented at its own site below and in CHANGELOG.md rather than smuggled in quietly:

  (a) SIGMA_SUPERVISE_SLEEP_SCALE is now a float, not a bash integer.
  (b) `shlex.split(cmd)` applies real shell-style quote handling to
      SIGMA_CLAUDE_CMD, where bash's unquoted `$CMD` expansion retained quote
      characters LITERALLY (a variable's expansion is not re-quoted) — so
      `claude -p "hello world"` word-split differently under each: bash produced
      four tokens (quotes as literal characters); `shlex.split` produces three,
      consuming the quotes the way the operator almost certainly meant. This is a
      latent-bug fix, not a regression, but it IS an observable behaviour change.
  (c) A new, additive log/stdout line (`supervisor: pausing ...`, see below) and a
      new exit code 2 for a non-numeric env value (see below) — both are NEW
      observable behaviour, not present in the bash original.

These three are the only OBSERVABLE-OUTCOME divergences. Separately — and NOT counted above,
because the goal there is restoring bash's own outcome, not changing it — two failure modes bash
survived for free (via `set -uo pipefail` WITHOUT `-e`: a failed shell redirection just prints to
stderr and the loop continues) needed EXPLICIT handling here, since Python raises where the shell
merely warns: (1) `SIGMA_CLAUDE_CMD` naming a missing/unusable executable (or splitting to an
empty argv) is caught and turned into a `_CRASH_SIG`-matching diagnostic in `$RUNOUT`, so the
classifier reaches the same crash-backoff verdict bash's own "command not found" line produced;
(2) every write to `supervisor.log`/`supervisor.tail` is tolerant of `OSError` (an unwritable
`state/` dir or a read-only file), warned once per distinct target via `_warn_unwritable_once`
rather than either crashing or going silent about it. Both are RESILIENCY fixes matching bash's
own designed tolerance, not new behaviour to disclose as a divergence.

Windows (#2494, validated against a real windows-latest GitHub Actions runner): plain
`shlex.split(cmd)` (POSIX mode) is GENUINELY BROKEN on win32, and not for the quoting reason this
docstring used to speculate about. POSIX shlex treats a bare backslash as an escape character
EVEN OUTSIDE quotes, so it silently eats every backslash in an ordinary Windows path — splitting
`C` colon backslash `Python312` backslash `python.exe -c 1` returns `C:Python312python.exe`,
`-c`, `1` as the first token — every backslash gone, not a quoting mismatch but outright path
corruption. Since almost every real
`SIGMA_CLAUDE_CMD` on Windows names an executable by its backslash-separated path, this was
not a theoretical/quoting-only risk: it broke the FIRST word of the command on every real
invocation. `_split_claude_cmd` below fixes this: on win32 it splits with `shlex.split(cmd,
posix=False)` (which preserves backslashes verbatim and still groups a `"..."`-quoted argument as
one token) and then strips one matching pair of leading/trailing double quotes off each token —
covering a plain path (unaffected either way) and a simple `"quoted argument"` (the case
`test_windows_real.py::test_supervise_relaunch_stop_file_and_run_id_through_a_quoted_windows_command`
exercises for real). This is NOT a byte-faithful implementation of MSVCRT/CommandLineToArgvW argv
parsing — a quoted argument containing an ESCAPED embedded quote (`\"`) is not specially handled
and is not claimed to be. POSIX (`sys.platform != "win32"`) behaviour is completely unchanged.

# own relaunches (so a session's `loop.py verify` and its later `loop.py record`
# share it), and unique BETWEEN concurrent supervisors (two workers = two daemon
# processes = two ids). Every child session — and, unlike the bash original,
# `supervise_classify.py` too, since both now go through the same explicit
# `env=child_env` — inherits it, so state.done_refusal can refuse a CONCURRENT
# sibling's green instead of silently inheriting it. Without a producer here the
# guard degrades to freshness-only (the pre-#498 bug). An id set by an outer
# launcher is respected (never clobbered); `os.getpid()` + `int(time.time())` +
# a bounded random tail keep it practically unique between concurrent supervisors
# — exactness of range is not the guarantee, non-collision-in-practice is (the
# same guarantee bash's `$RANDOM` gave, since it is not cryptographically unique
# either). `random.randint(0, 32767)` mirrors bash `$RANDOM`'s range closely
# enough to preserve that property.
#
# H2 (plan-review, BLOCKING): the bash original `export`ed this into its own
# process environment, and an earlier draft of this port did the same via
# `os.environ[...] = run_id`. That is WRONG in Python: `os.environ` is this
# process's global, interpreter-wide environment, and importing this module (as
# the test suite's `_daemon_mod()` does, to reach `extract_sleep_seconds` and
# `CLASSIFIER_UNAVAILABLE_FALLBACK` directly) must never be able to mutate a
# caller's environment as a side effect — `monkeypatch.delenv` cannot revert a
# raw `os.environ[...] = ...` performed deep inside `main()`, so an in-process
# call would leak `SIGMA_RUN_ID` into whatever test runs next (this bit
# `tests/test_state.py`, which depends on the exact absence/presence of that
# key). The fix: never write to `os.environ` at all. Build `child_env` ONCE —
# a plain dict, `{**os.environ, "SIGMA_RUN_ID": run_id}` — and pass it via
# `env=child_env` explicitly to BOTH subprocess launches below (the session
# command and the classifier). This delivers the identical observable contract
# `export` gave (every child and grandchild of the LAUNCHED subprocess inherits
# one stable id) with zero global mutation.

# `main()` prints exactly one line, `f"action={action} sleep={secs} reason={reason}"`
# — this daemon extracts `secs` from that EXACT shape with an ANCHORED regex, never
# an unanchored/greedy search. Why anchoring matters (PR #744 blocking finding,
# #176): `_ABNORMAL`'s `reason` field is the ONE place in `supervise_classify.py`
# where session-authored free text enters the verdict line, and a session can name
# its own `sleep=<n>` inside that free text (e.g. "LOOP STOP: worktree corrupt; env
# dump showed leftover sleep=999999 from a prior test"). An UNANCHORED, greedy
# search (the historical bash `sed -n 's/.*sleep=\([0-9]*\).*/\1/p'`, ported
# naively as `re.findall(r"sleep=(\d*)", verdict)[-1]`) captures the LAST
# `sleep=<digits>` on the line — which may be the session's injected number, not
# the classifier's own fixed-position field — inflating a 300s pause into an
# ~11.5-day one while the log still claims 300s.
#
# Anchor-by-anchor justification against the sed this replaces (H4, plan-review
# non-blocking #4 — corrected here to the BYTE-FAITHFUL translation):
#   ^                — sed's `s/^...` anchors to line start; `re.match` already
#                       anchors to the string's start, equivalent for a single-line
#                       verdict (the classifier prints exactly one `.strip()`-ready
#                       line, so "string start" and "line start" coincide here —
#                       the one place this would diverge, embedded newlines inside
#                       the verdict itself, cannot occur since nothing that reaches
#                       this line contains one).
#   action=[^ ]*      — sed matches literal `action=` then any run of NON-SPACE
#                       characters. H4 corrected an earlier draft here: `[^ ]*` is
#                       ZERO-or-more and admits a literal tab; Python's `\S+` is
#                       ONE-or-more and admits no whitespace at all — NOT the same
#                       set. `[^ ]*` is the byte-faithful translation. (The
#                       divergence is unreachable on real input either way, since
#                       `supervise_classify.py` never emits a tab here — but the
#                       plan's job is to remove the question, not argue it's safe.)
#    sleep=(\d*)      — a literal space, `sleep=`, then a CAPTURED, possibly-EMPTY
#                       digit run — `\d*` (zero-or-more) matches the same empty
#                       string sed's `\([0-9]*\)` does, so the `${secs:-1800}`

#                       is genuinely empty.
#    .*               — sed's pattern ends ` .*` (a literal space then any-chars-
#                       to-end), REQUIRING at least one more field (`reason=...`)
#                       to follow. Keeping this trailing ` .*` costs nothing (every
