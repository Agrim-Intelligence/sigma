"""Exit-classifier for the overnight supervisor (zero-dep, pure, hermetically testable).

Reads the TAIL of a finished loop session's output and decides what the supervisor
does next. Four verdicts:
  done     — the loop's own success stop ("backlog-empty" / its stop report): exit.
  relaunch — a per-run budget stop, OR (#2521) a planned context hand-off: both reset per
             invocation BY DESIGN, so relaunch after a short fixed pause (the pause + the
             supervisor's max-runs cap prevent a hot ping-pong on a non-progressing backlog).
             A hand-off is never a problem — it is the orchestrating session retiring itself on
             purpose, before its own accumulated context becomes the next compaction.
  sleep    — usage-limit exhaustion WITH a parseable reset time: sleep until
             reset + jitter, then relaunch (the 12:00 -> 3:00 -> 5:30 scenario).
  backoff  — usage-limit without a parseable time, an unknown crash, or (#1084) a DONE whose
             backlog read was itself degraded (ambiguous, not confirmed empty): capped
             escalating waits (cheap retries, never a hot loop, no permanent stop
             until the supervisor's max-runs cap).

`relaunch` also covers the two endings that are neither success nor crash, and which this
classifier originally had no name for -- so it charged both the escalating CRASH ladder:

  * a session that LANDED GOALS and exited without any stop marker. This is the ordinary
    outcome of a healthy overnight run, not a fault.
  * any clean, self-declared `LOOP STOP: <reason>` -- the loop naming its own blocker, not just
    the literal word `blocked` (widened 2026-08-11: `LOOP STOP: interrupted by operator` and
    `LOOP STOP: worktree corrupt` are declared abnormal stops too, and used to be byte-for-byte
    indistinguishable from a tail with no marker at all). The declared reason is echoed LOUDLY,
    prefixed `ABNORMAL STOP`, so a declared problem is never mistaken for silence in the log.

Measured live on 2026-08-04: consecutive runs that merged a PR and that stopped blocked-on-
permissions were each scored "unclassified exit", walking the ladder to 300s -> 600s -> 1200s
-> 3600s-forever. The loop then sleeps up to an hour BETWEEN SUCCESSFUL GOALS, which inverts
what the backoff is for. Escalation must be reserved for endings we genuinely cannot explain.

Inherited limit (pre-existing, not introduced here -- `_DONE` has the identical weakness):
anchoring stops a MENTION of a marker from firing, but a marker quoted on its OWN LINE still
fires. `_ABNORMAL`'s match surface is far wider than `_DONE`'s or `_BUDGET`'s, so it is likelier
to bite in practice -- not fixed here.

The classifier never talks to any API and adds zero LLM calls — it reads text.

# says so ("At STOP, print one machine-readable line FIRST"), this only enforces it. Unanchored,
# these patterns matched a session that was being scrupulously HONEST: having hit a blocker it
# refused to emit a stop it had not earned and said so --
#     "I'm deliberately not printing `LOOP STOP: backlog-empty` ...; neither is true, and
#      emitting one would tell your tooling something false."
# -- and the classifier read that disclaimer as the marker, exiting action=done with 28 goals
# queued. Honesty was indistinguishable from success. A mention of a marker, a quote of one, or a
# negation of one must never BE one.
