"""The managed block in `.sdlc/features/<name>.md` (#1470, epic #1464, story #1427).

`feature_registry.py` is the machine truth -- `units/<name>.json` and the `index.json` chart sheet.
This module owns the OTHER half of the same registry: the file a person opens. One file, two owners:

    <!-- sigma:begin managed sha256:... -->
    ...regenerated from the registry -- do not edit...
    <!-- sigma:end managed -->

    ## Notes
    Anything a human writes below is theirs and is never touched.

THE FOUR RULES, IN THE PRECEDENCE ORDER THE ISSUE STATES THEM, AND WHERE EACH ONE LIVES:

  1. THE REGISTRY IS AUTHORITATIVE FOR STRUCTURED STATE. The block is rendered FROM an entry
     (`render_block`), and prose is never parsed to recover state on the normal path. `parse_block`
     and `recover` exist only for rule 4, and `sync` reaches them only when the registry has nothing
     to say -- see `recover`'s own docstring for why this separation is the rule rather than a
     stylistic one.
  2. THE REGION OUTSIDE THE BLOCK IS HUMAN-OWNED AND NEVER REWRITTEN. This module therefore works on
     BYTES from end to end and never decodes the human region at all. Reading `<name>.md` as text
     would translate CRLF to LF and replace undecodable bytes; writing it back would then silently
     rewrite prose this module promised not to touch, and every result-shaped test would still pass.
     A splice of `data[:start] + block + data[stop:]` is the only form that makes "byte-identical"
     literally true rather than approximately true.
  3. A HAND-EDIT INSIDE THE BLOCK IS OVERWRITTEN, AND THE DIVERGENCE IS WRITTEN TO THE LEDGER.
     Silently discarding somebody's edit is the one outcome to avoid; overwriting it while saying so
     is fine, because the block is marked as not theirs.
  4. A `<name>.md` WITH NO ENTRY IN THE REGISTRY is rebuilt from what still parses, and if nothing
     does, it is LEFT UNTOUCHED AND FLAGGED -- never deleted, never truncated.

WHY THE BLOCK CARRIES A CHECKSUM OF ITS OWN BODY, which is this module's one real design decision.
Rule 3 needs to separate "a human typed in the block" from "the registry changed", and the two
obvious tests cannot:

  - comparing the block on disk with the block about to be written reports a divergence on every
    ordinary registry change, and a signal that fires every time is not a signal;
  - re-rendering what the block parses to and comparing that with the block on disk looks stricter
    and is in fact blind exactly where it matters: a hand-edit that changes a TITLE leaves a
    perfectly canonical block, so the re-render matches, the check passes, and the edit is discarded
    in silence -- the precise failure rule 3 exists to prevent.

So the begin marker carries `sha256:<16 hex>` over the block's body. A body its digest vouches for
was last written by this module; one it does not vouch for was not, and is reported. The digest is
TRUNCATED to 64 bits deliberately: the property needed is "an edit changes it", for which any
collision-resistant prefix suffices, and this line is the first thing a human sees in the file. It
is tamper-EVIDENT, not tamper-proof -- someone who recomputes a digest to hide an edit has decided
to hide it, and no marker in a text file can stop that.

WHAT A COLLISION COSTS, SAID PLAINLY, because 64 bits is a judgement and a judgement should carry
its downside: an edited body whose digest happens to match the recorded one is treated as vouched,
so it is discarded IN SILENCE and reported as `UPDATED` -- the exact outcome rule 3 exists to
prevent. This is a targeted match at 2^-64, not a birthday problem: there is one recorded digest and
one body, and the edit has to hit it. Widening the field buys nothing against someone who has
decided to recompute the digest anyway, and costs the first line of the file its readability.

A BLOCK WITH NO DIGEST AT ALL IS REPORTED TOO, and that is the deliberate direction. A block
somebody wrote by hand, or one whose attribute a person deleted, cannot vouch for itself -- and
"cannot prove nothing was discarded" has to fail towards saying so. It lands as `STAMPED` rather
than as a divergence, because "cannot prove" is not "somebody edited this"; the cost is one report
the first time such a file is synced, and the alternative cost is a lost edit, silently.

THAT LANDING PLACE IS PERMANENT, NOT TRANSITIONAL, and being exact about why matters: a person
CANNOT hand-write a valid digest, because it covers a body they have not written yet. No amount of
documenting the attributed form changes that. What documentation does control is which PLACEHOLDER
gets copied, and that choice is load-bearing in a way that is easy to get backwards -- see
`_CHECKSUM_RE` for the measurement.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE. Nothing on this module's write path touches the registry: no shard,
no chart sheet, no registry file of any kind, read or written. (Precisely: the only `.json` anywhere
in reach is `.sdlc/config.json`, which `ledger.safe_append` reads inside its own guard to find out
whether the ledger is even on -- the ledger's own gate, not the registry, and a read.) The doc is
DOWNSTREAM of the machine truth, and a sync that wrote back into the registry would make prose an
input to it -- rule 1 inverted. Deciding WHEN to sync,
cross-checking a branch against the branches that actually exist, and folding a recovered entry back
into the registry all belong to the pick-path sync, #1473. Propagating a file to a sibling repo is
#1477. This module answers one question: given a unit and what the registry says about it, what
should `<name>.md` contain, and what was lost in getting there?

Module shape follows `feature_registry.py` and `features.py`: no third-party dependencies,
module-level constants, siblings loaded via `_load`.

#: `feature_registry` for itself holds a DIFFERENT class object from the one this module raises, and
#: `except registry.InvalidUnitName` against that other instance would not catch this one. Binding
#: the name here gives a caller a class reached through the module that actually raises it, which is

#: A field line, and a value. A value is DELIMITED BY BACKTICKS so that absent (no delimiters) and
#: empty (empty delimiters) stay distinguishable, and so that a title full of markdown renders as

#:
#: A hand-written block can NEVER carry a valid digest, because a person cannot compute the digest
#: of a body they have not written yet. `STAMPED` is therefore where every hand-authored block

#:
#:     sha256:0123456789abcdef        -> parses as a digest -> MISMATCH -> accuses a named owner
#:     sha256:<written-by-sigma>  -> parses as absent   -> cannot-prove -> benign, one report
#:
#: A plausible-looking concrete digest in a document is thus strictly WORSE than printing no
#: attribute at all: every file copied from it lands as a divergence naming somebody, for exactly
#: the population `STAMPED` exists to protect. Pinned by a test, because prose in a document this
#: repository does not contain cannot be pinned any other way.

#:    what makes `_unescape` unambiguous (`\\n` is a literal backslash then an `n`, `\n` is a
#:    newline), and what makes `_split_cells` able to skip an escaped delimiter by pairs;
#:  - `` ` `` because it delimits every value;
#:  - `|` because a raw one splits the table row it lands in, and the value comes back truncated --
#:    silent loss, invisible in a rendered table;
#:  - `\n` and `\r` because this file is parsed by lines. `\r` matters on its own: a lone `\r` looks
#:    like a line break to a human and to some renderers while `split("\n")` never sees it, which is
#:    the same class of hole `ledger._cell` records having to close twice.
#:
#: DELIBERATELY NOT `splitlines()`'s FULL SET (`\v`, `\f`, `\x85`, ` `, ...). That set is the
#: right one for `ledger._cell`, which flattens a value into a markdown table it does not control.
#: Here the parser is this module's own and splits on `"\n"` ALONE, so those characters are not
#: structural -- they pass through verbatim and come back verbatim. Escaping them would be
#: cosmetics bought at the price of a lossier round trip.

         is reported: to the caller in the report, on stderr, and to the ledger by file name;
      4. with no entry the file is never written. It is recovered from if its block still says
         something, and flagged if it does not.

    RAISES `InvalidUnitName` on a name that is not a unit name, and otherwise only what the
    filesystem raises on a write that genuinely failed -- the same division `feature_registry.
    write_unit` draws, and for the same reason: a caller writing `../escape` has a bug, not a
    corrupt file, and a disk that cannot be written to is not something to swallow.

    `goal` is what the ledger records this against; it defaults to the unit name, which is the only

    # carry no newline, so `_lf` is the identity on them) and the bodies to match modulo line
    # endings, hence `recorded == _checksum(body)`, hence `vouched`. The clause cannot change
    # today's outcome. It states the condition that actually matters -- do not call a block
    # UNCHANGED while its provenance is unknown -- and it is the half that survives if the digest
    # ever moves out of the marker, at which point the implication silently stops holding.
