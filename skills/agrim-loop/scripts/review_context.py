"""Assemble the context an INDEPENDENT reviewer needs — the project, never the author.

THE PROBLEM. A maker that reviews its own work rationalizes it; on a lower-tier model that confirmation
bias amplifies hallucination exactly where a review is supposed to catch it. So every review gate
(plan-review, code review, the post-PR review) must run as a FRESH reviewer that never saw the maker's
reasoning. But a fresh reviewer handed only the diff has the opposite failure: it cannot see BLAST
RADIUS — the callers a small change breaks two files away, the invariant it quietly violates — because
the change is on screen and the impact surface is not. The reviewer needs the PROJECT (what it is for,
its rules, the whole codebase to read), not the AUTHOR (their justifications).

WHERE THE BOUNDARY IS. A python script cannot spawn a subagent — only the agent can (the same boundary
`slices.py` states). So this module COMPUTES the reviewer's context PACK and the SKILL prose DISPATCHES
one fresh subagent per review, fed only this pack. The value here is that the payload is assembled by
code: the maker's transcript is excluded BY CONSTRUCTION (there is no field for it), and what the
reviewer is told — "trace blast radius across the whole repo" — is consistent
across every gate and testable, instead of prose each phase is trusted to reproduce.

WHAT GOES IN. The project's own words, north-star first (same ordering `agrim-context` uses), but here
UN-GATED by the knowledge graph and reviewer-framed: the north-star (vision / strategy / non-goals /
numbered architecture rules the plan is judged against), project.md + every governing CLAUDE.md
(root AND directory-scoped), the
contracts dir, the goal, and a pointer to the artifact under review. Never the maker's context.

Fail-open: a missing file drops its line, never raises — a reviewer with a partial brief still reviews;
one that crashed assembling the brief reviews nothing. ASCII-only output (a non-utf8 locale must not
break it). Zero deps.

    ONE level only: a child's parent, never a recursive climb. A grandparent adds context the

    `sdlc/<goal>` (`.gitignore`'s `!.sdlc/plans/` / `!.sdlc/research/` exceptions), while every
    documented gesture runs the brief from the MAIN checkout with `<sdlc_dir>` = `.sdlc` — a tree
    where they may never have existed. Measured on #2575: a 1072-line plan and a 466-line dossier,
    both present on `origin/sdlc/2575`, both reported to the reviewer as absent, with the plan's
    absence phrased as an instruction to "judge against the goal alone".

    This is a FALLBACK, not a replacement — `brief()` asks the filesystem first. That order is
    deliberate and is pinned by a test: `references/landing.md` ("the reviewer BRIEF reads the main
    checkout's, the PR's reviewer reads the branch's") splits the two copies on purpose, and a plan
    CORRECTION (#2237) is written into the main checkout's copy before anything commits it — so
    reading the branch first would serve the stale committed text, which is the same silent
    degradation this function exists to remove.

    The repo is derived from `sdlc_dir`, never from `brief()`'s `repo_root`: that argument means
    "where the conventions and contracts live" and defaults to the CWD, so a caller pointing it at
    another tree would silently desync the two. Same rule as `work.project_root`.

    The local ref is tried before `<remote>/<branch>` — during a goal's own run the local branch is
    authoritative and the push lags — but the remote is not optional: `work.py finish` deletes the
    local branch, so on the main checkout that measured this bug `git show sdlc/2575:...` answers
    "invalid object name" while `origin/sdlc/2575` resolves.

    The pointer handed to the reviewer is the runnable `git show <ref>:<path>`, not a path: that
    path does not exist on disk here, and pointing at a file the reviewer cannot open would be a
    second silent degradation. It needs a shell, which `reviewer.py`'s `subagent` and `process`
    mechanisms have and an operator's `command` reviewer may not — better than today's silence,
    not parity with a local file.

    COST, measured on this repo: 2 git calls per artifact resolved off a branch, 1 per ref that does
    not resolve — so a `pr-review` brief adds 6 when both plan and dossier come off the branch, 4
    when no ref exists, and 0 when both are on disk. ~10ms each against a 0.76s brief. The `ls-tree`
    is linear in the ref's tracked artifacts for that subdir (50 plan files here), so 100x that tree
    is still one listing, not 100 calls. Deliberately UN-memoised: the two subdirs repeat the same
    two `ls-tree`s, and a cache would have to be invalidated across a long-lived process for ~20ms.
    The ceiling to know is the timeout: it is PER CALL, so a wedged git costs up to 40-80s per
    brief, not 10."""

    """The path of the artifact filed for this goal under `.sdlc/<subdir>/`, or None.

    Split out from `_phase_doc` because the plan block needs the PATH as well as the text: it inlines
    only the outline and hands the reviewer the file to open when a heading is not enough.

    PUBLIC because it now has a second consumer outside this module: `work.py`'s pre-push guard
    (#1548) asks the same question — "which file is this goal's plan?" — before refusing to publish a
    branch that does not carry it. Deliberately the SAME resolver the reviewer brief uses, stem/slug
    fallback included: two resolvers would let a goal be judged plan-less by the guard and plan-ful
    by the reviewer it exists to serve.

    #1808: in github mode `$goal` is a BARE issue number with no slug of its own, but Research and
    Plan both routinely append one when they FILE the artifact — agrim-research/SKILL.md's own
    instruction is `.sdlc/research/<goal-slug>.md` — producing a real, on-disk name like
    `1756-repo-identity-declared-override.md`. The exact-name checks above never match that (the
    numeric stem has no dash to split on, so `slug == stem`), so a dossier that genuinely exists read
    as absent — confirmed live on goal #1756/PR #1806, and the second independent false-negative
    report for the identical goal. Scoped to a PURELY NUMERIC stem only: a local goal's stem already
    carries its own real slug and is matched exactly above, and loosening this for it too would let
    an unrelated same-prefixed file answer for the wrong goal. `stem.isdigit()` also means the glob
    pattern below can never carry a traversal or shell-metacharacter payload — it is only digits.
