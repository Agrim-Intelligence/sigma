"""The pick-path registry sync -- `.sdlc/features/` reconciled on every goal pick (#1473, epic
#1464, story #1427).

`feature_registry` (#1469) is the store and `feature_doc` (#1470) is its human-readable half. Both
are pure; neither is ever called. THIS is the thing that runs, and the design's own sentence is the
whole specification of what it must do:

    live state comes from the REMOTE; history survives LOCALLY; NEITHER IS TRUSTED ALONE.

So one pass does three things, in that order: record the goal under the unit its issue declared,
cross-check what the registry CLAIMS against the branches that actually EXIST, and regenerate the
managed block from the result.

WHERE THIS RUNS, AND WHY IT IS `work.start()` RATHER THAN `loop._next`. Two call sites could be
called "the pick", and #1472 already put the cross-repo landing check on the other one. This one is
chosen for three reasons that are all about not asking a second time:

  1. `start()` has ALREADY resolved the unit. `_declared_unit` returns it as a local variable, so
     the sync is handed the answer in-process and reads no issue of its own. That is the whole of
     requirement 1 and it is satisfied structurally rather than by discipline -- there is no code
     path here that could make the read even if a later author wanted to. #1472 had to DELETE its
     own reader to reach the same property; this one never has one.
  2. `start()` is the only layer holding a git runner scoped to the project root, and the
     cross-check against real branches is a git question about a remote, not a `gh` question about
     an issue.
  3. `work._declared_unit`'s own docstring defers exactly this question -- "whether the branch
     exists at all (L2's registry)" -- from that function, on that path.

THE HONEST LIMIT OF THAT CHOICE, stated rather than discovered later: a project with `work.enabled`
false never calls `start()`, so it never syncs. That project also cuts no branches and opens no PRs,
so the branching model has nothing to record about it -- but the two facts are connected by
coincidence, not by construction, and a future goal that gives such a project feature branches has
to move this call rather than assume it followed.

ORDER MATTERS, AND IT IS THE ONE ORDERING DECISION HERE. The sync runs BEFORE `start()`'s `git
fetch`. A brand-new unit has no branch yet, and that fetch correctly fails closed on exactly that --
so a sync placed after it would miss the first goal of every new unit, which is the one goal that
creates the entry. Running first means the registry learns about the unit, the missing branch is
surfaced, and the fetch's own failure arrives as a diagnosis instead of a mystery.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAME-UNIT CONCURRENCY, WHICH IS THE REAL PROBLEM THIS MODULE SOLVES

#1469 gave each unit its own shard, so two picks on DIFFERENT units are structurally incapable of
colliding. It also measured, and documented, what that does not buy: two picks on the SAME unit are
a read-modify-write with no lock, so the last writer wins the whole file. Measured again here at
real process level before writing a line of the fix -- 10 processes, one shard, one goal number
each, five runs: 5 to 6 of 10 goal numbers LOST per run. At 4 goals each: 17 to 19 of 40. Never
corrupt -- `os.replace` holds and every read parses -- just silently absent, which is worse than a
crash because nothing looks wrong.

Two goals on one unit picked at once is not an exotic case. It is what a unit of work IS, and what a
parallel drain produces by design. And a lost goal number defeats the registry's entire purpose: it
exists so that when a remote branch is deleted, what belonged to that unit is still knowable, and a
silently short list is that failure dressed as success.

THE ANSWER IS A PER-UNIT `flock`, AND THE ALTERNATIVES WERE REAL:

  - an append-only shard per writing process (the ledger's answer, one axis further) is the most
    robust of the three and was rejected on blast radius, not on merit: it would change the layout
    `read()` reads, which the 2026-08-22 amendment settled and #1477 is about to copy verbatim
    between repos. Re-opening a settled layout ruling from the goal that consumes it is the wrong
    direction of travel;
  - a compare-and-swap retry cannot be built honestly on POSIX. `os.replace` is unconditional, so
    "write only if nothing changed" has no primitive under it, and a re-read-after-write loop
    converges only probabilistically -- A can verify its own write and be clobbered by B a
    microsecond later, having already returned success;
  - `flock` is the one that is exact. It is kernel-mediated, so it has no stale-lock problem at all:
    a holder that crashes releases it, which is the property a lockfile-by-existence never has.
    `loop.py`'s claim lock is the same primitive, so this is the codebase's own idiom rather than a
    new one.

The retry loop stays anyway, as a BACKSTOP rather than the mechanism -- see `amend`. And the lock
file lives under `.sdlc/state/`, never beside the shards: `.sdlc/features/` is deliberately NOT
gitignored (a gitignored backup is not a backup), so a lock there would be untracked litter in every
adopter's `git status`, while `.sdlc/state/` is already covered by `setup.RUNTIME_IGNORES`.

WHAT THE FAIL-OPEN PATH CAN AND CANNOT DO, MEASURED, BECAUSE AN EARLIER VERSION OF THIS FILE CLAIMED
MORE THAN IT COULD KEEP. When no lock can be taken at all -- no `fcntl`, a filesystem that cannot
flock, a wedged holder that timed out -- the retry is all there is, and the objection this module
raises against CAS three paragraphs up applies to it VERBATIM: a writer can verify its own write and
be clobbered a microsecond later, having already returned. Measured on that path, 10 processes x 4
goals: 40 of 40 writes reported success and 11 to 16 of them were absent afterwards. The retry does
NARROW the loss (bare loses more), and it is exact for a write that never landed at all -- but it
cannot see a clobber that arrives after it looked.

So the honesty is structural rather than promised, in three parts:

  1. `landed` MEANS `written AND serialised` -- the only combination in which "recorded" is a fact
     rather than a likelihood. An unserialised write reports `written: True, landed: False`, which
     is the true statement: the bytes went in, and nothing can prove they stayed;
  2. a RE-READ AT THE END OF THE PASS catches the clobbers that arrived while the rest of the pass
     was running, which is most of them in practice and none of them in principle. What it finds is
     `LOST`, and `LOST` is a measurement, not an inference;
  3. both `UNSERIALISED` and `LOST` reach the operator through the clause `work.start()` prints, so
     the signal has a consumer rather than sitting in a field nobody reads.

The residual is named rather than left to be discovered: a clobber that lands after the final
re-read is invisible to this process, and no lock-free scheme on POSIX can see it. That is a reason
to have the lock, not a reason to pretend the fallback is one.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO

`index.json` IS NEVER WRITTEN ON THE PICK PATH, and this is a ruling, not an omission. #1469 left
the fold to this goal -- "whether that pass then removes the shards it folded in is #1473's call".
The call is: fold on demand (`fold()`, the CLI verb), never on a pick, and NEVER remove a shard.

  - not on a pick, because `index.json` is the one file every unit would share, and the whole point
    of the amendment was to stop concurrent picks rewriting one file. Folding it back in on every
    pick would restore exactly the merge conflicts on exactly the file that exists to be a backup;
  - never removing a folded shard, because a shard written by a concurrent process between this
    pass's `read` and its delete would be deleted having never been folded. `read`'s union is
    already correct with both present, so removal buys tidiness and risks the data.

Cross-repo propagation (#1477) and ownership enforcement (#1479) are not here either. This records
the goal, reconciles against reality, and stops.

    THE WHOLE READ-MODIFY-WRITE HAPPENS UNDER THE UNIT'S OWN LOCK, which is the entire point of this
    function and the answer to the loss #1469 measured. `mutate` is handed a NORMALISED copy of the
    effective entry (`read`'s union, so a fresh clone carrying only `index.json` amends the sheet's
    entry rather than erasing it) and mutates it in place. The WHOLE entry goes back -- never a
    delta, which `write_unit` documents as the caller's non-optional obligation, since `read`
    replaces a unit's entry with its shard rather than merging the two.

    NOTHING IS WRITTEN WHEN NOTHING CHANGED. A re-pick recording a goal already recorded produces an
    identical entry, and rewriting it would make every pass a diff in a directory that is committed
    on purpose. The comparison is on the NORMALISED forms, which is also what makes de-duplication
    free: `_goals` already de-dupes and coerces `"2879"` to `2879`, so `mutate` may append blindly
    and the "did anything change?" question answers itself correctly.

    THE RETRY IS A BACKSTOP, NOT THE MECHANISM, and the distinction is worth being exact about. With
    the lock held the write cannot be clobbered mid-section, so the verify never fires. It exists
    for the fail-open case -- no `fcntl`, an unlockable filesystem, a wedged holder that timed out,
    or a writer from a version of this plugin that predates the lock -- where it converts a silent
    loss into a retried write. It is BOUNDED, because an adversarial or simply broken co-writer must
    not be able to spin a pick forever.

    AND IT IS NOT A GUARANTEE, WHICH THIS DOCSTRING USED TO SAY IT WAS. The verify reads back a write
    it has just made; a co-writer holding stale state can clobber that write a microsecond later,
    after the read and before this function returns. That is the same objection the module docstring
    uses to reject compare-and-swap, and it applies here unchanged -- measured on the fail-open path
    at 40 of 40 writes reporting success with 11 to 16 of them absent afterwards. The verify is exact
    for a write that never landed AT ALL (a sabotaged `write_unit` reports `landed: False` after
    `WRITE_ATTEMPTS`); it is blind to a clobber that arrives after it looked.

    SO THE REPORT SEPARATES THE TWO CLAIMS RATHER THAN CONFLATING THEM:

      - `written` -- the shard on disk said what we wrote, at the moment we looked. Provable, and
        this is what "the goal was recorded" is entitled to rest on;
      - `serialised` -- the read-modify-write happened under an exclusive lock;
      - `landed` -- `written and serialised`, and NOTHING ELSE. It is the only field that means
        "recorded, and nothing could have taken it away", so it is the only one that must never
        overstate. On the fail-open path it is False even when the write plainly went in, because
        False there is the true statement.

    `sync_at_pick` re-reads the shard at the END of the pass for any unserialised write and reports
    `LOST` for a goal that is no longer there. That is a measurement rather than an inference, and it
    catches the clobbers that arrive while the rest of the pass runs -- not the ones that arrive
    after it, which nothing lock-free can catch.

    RAISES `InvalidUnitName` on a name that is not a unit name (via `lock_path`), and whatever the
    filesystem raises on a write that genuinely failed. `sync_at_pick` is the layer that turns those
    into a report; a direct caller gets the exception, the same division `feature_registry.write_unit`
    and `feature_doc.sync` both draw."""

    `branches` is a frozenset, or None when the remote could not be read; `reason` is "" on success
    and the flattened error text otherwise. EXACTLY ONE OF THEM IS SET, which is the same
    `(value, note, ok)` shape `work._declared_unit` uses one function along on this very pick path,
    and for the identical reason it gives: "the read failed" is NOT the same fact as "the answer is
    nothing", and a function that returns only the value forces its caller to collapse them.

    `None` AND `frozenset()` ARE NOT THE SAME ANSWER AND MUST NEVER BE COLLAPSED. `None` is "the
    remote could not be read"; the empty set is "the remote was read and has no feature branches".
    Reading the first as the second is the single most destructive bug available here -- it deletes
    every recorded branch and closes every unit, in one pass, silently, on a laptop that happened to
    be offline. Every caller checks for `None` first, and `reconcile` refuses outright.

    THE REASON IS RETURNED RATHER THAN SWALLOWED, and that is a correction: this used to `except`
    into a bare `None`, so a pass that cross-checked NOTHING was indistinguishable from a pass that
    cross-checked everything and found it all correct -- while still reporting `outcome: "synced"`,
    which actively asserts the second. The registry's own definition of done requires a divergence
    to be "surfaced rather than silently trusted", and on that path local was trusted alone, in
    silence. `_sync_at_pick` turns this reason into a `REMOTE_UNREADABLE` divergence.

    `ls-remote`, not `for-each-ref`: the question is about the REMOTE's branches, and a local
    remote-tracking ref is a cache of the last fetch, which is precisely the stale local state this
    pass exists to reconcile against. The pattern filters server-side, so the reply stays small on a

    path will not spend. The approximation errs towards leaving a unit open, which is the direction
    #1469 already chose for the same field -- closing is what makes a unit's goals stop being
    recorded, so the safe guess is that nobody closed anything.

    `open` IS NEVER SET BACK TO TRUE HERE. Only a human (or `open`'s own default) opens a unit;

    owner's decision rather than a pick's.

    flows registry -> repos and never repo -> registry: `setdefault` here USED to add the picking
    repo to `repos` unconditionally, which is precisely the silent registry edit the one-directional
    rule forbids -- any issue in any repo could have widened a unit into a codebase its owner never
    agreed to touch, through the one field the registry exists to be authoritative about. The
    divergence is reported and reaches the unit owner through the ledger; the entry is untouched.

    THE GOAL IS APPENDED BLINDLY, AND THAT IS CORRECT. `feature_registry._goals` de-duplicates in
    first-seen order and coerces `"2879"` to `2879`, and #1469's docstring says why in as many
    words -- "de-duplicated because #1473 re-picks a goal onto a unit it is already recorded under".

      - only when MEASURED, because with `live` unknown, writing `feature/<name>` would be the
        registry asserting a branch exists on the strength of a naming convention. That is trusting
        local alone, which the design's own sentence forbids.

#:
#: Measured live on 1.4.1, not inferred: `docs/branching-model.md` §14's steps opened a real unit,
#: two goals were cut from its branch, and NEITHER was recorded -- `_sync_at_pick`'s opt-out returned
#: `not-adopted` and swallowed it, with no error, no warning and no stderr line, while §14 promised
#: "recorded against it" a paragraph below. The opt-out's SEMANTICS were never wrong. Its silence
#: was, in exactly the way `REMOTE_UNREADABLE` above records for a remote that could not be read.
#:
#: ONLY WHEN A UNIT IS DECLARED, and that condition is the whole design rather than a filter on
#: noise. Declaring a unit is the adopter asking for a record, so answering it with silence is the
#: failure; declaring none is a project that never asked, whose pick stays byte-identical -- same
#: report, same output, same calls -- which is what keeps the model adoptable without disturbing
#: anyone who never wanted it.
#:
#: SAID HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE. Five modules open with the same `is_dir()` opt-out
#: (`feature_propagate`, `feature_rebase`, `feature_owner`, `unit_completion` and `cross_repo`), and
#: a pick that printed one correction five times is a pick whose output nobody reads. This is the
#: one that promises the recording and the one `work.start()` calls first, so it is the one that
#: speaks.
#:
#: WHAT IT HAS TO CARRY, each part earned by what was missing on the day: WHICH directory (the trial
