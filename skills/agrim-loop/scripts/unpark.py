"""unpark.py (#1392) -- the human half of unparking: an interview that turns a park into either a
recorded decision or a re-pickable goal.

NOT `auto_unpark.py`. That module reverses the ONE park class it can PROVE is stale -- a named
blocker that has since closed -- and deliberately touches nothing else, because textual shape
cannot tell a genuinely-stale block from a human's deliberate checkpoint. This module handles
everything else, which is every park that needed a person in the first place: `needs_decision`,
`irreversible`, a failing check, a park whose reason is free prose. The two are complements, not
alternatives, and they share a repo: a `keep-parked` decision here writes `auto_unpark`'s own
`KEEP_PARKED_MARKER`, so a human decision recorded through this path is never re-litigated by the
automatic sweep on its next pass.

WHY AN INTERVIEW AND NOT A BUTTON. A park is a question nobody answered. Unparking without
answering it produces the worst outcome available: the goal is picked, an agent spends real effort
rediscovering the same obstacle, and parks it again -- with a fresh comment nobody reads either.
So the answers are the artifact, and the label change is a consequence of having them.

WHERE THE ANSWERS GO, AND THE TRAP IN PUTTING THEM THERE. They go in the issue BODY, not only in a
comment, because the next agent to pick this goal reads the body -- hunting comments is exactly how
context gets lost. But `backlog_check._BLOCK_RE` triggers on ordinary English ("needs", "after",
"requires", "waiting on", "depends on") within 40 characters of a `#N`, so an answer like "waiting
on the design sign-off, see #1234" would plant a PHANTOM blocker in the body of the goal that was
just unblocked and get it re-parked on the very next pick. Every recorded block is therefore fenced
in `backlog_check.UNPARK_QA_START`/`_END`, which `_blocker_haystack` strips before any scan -- the
same shape #1186 used against Sigma's own park boilerplate. A real "Blocked by #99" written
anywhere else in the body is still caught, unchanged.

WHERE THE QUESTIONS COME FROM, AND WHY NOT THE LEDGER. `reason_class` and `decision_tier` are
recorded ONLY into the ledger (`loop._record`), and `ledger.enabled` ships FALSE -- while
`decision_tier.resolve()` is itself gated on a `decision_tier: "auto"` key the template ships as
`"off"`. Reading either would make this whole module inert on a stock adopter. So both are
RE-DERIVED from text that is always present on the issue: `loop._reason_class` over the park
comment (prefix-stripped), and `decision_tier.classify` -- the UNGATED, pure classifier, never
`resolve`. The ledger, when a repo has it on, is optional enrichment and nothing more.
