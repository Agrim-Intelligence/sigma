    Deliberately total and never-raising. It accepts a bare tier (`P1`), any case (`p1`), and a
    value that still carries the GitHub label prefix (`priority:P1`) — so the GitHub side can hand
    it a raw label name and the local side a raw frontmatter value, without either having to know
    the other's spelling. A typo (`priority:high`, `P9`) is NOT guessed at: it ranks as
    unprioritised, which is the safe direction — a goal nobody can classify must not jump the
    queue on the strength of a misspelling.

    `aliases` (optional, default None) is a `{alternate spelling: canonical P0-P4 tier}` dict — an
    adopter's OWN vocabulary (`{"critical": "P0", "high": "P1", ...}`), config-driven (see
    `discovery.priority_aliases` in sources.py), so this stays a typo-safe exact match rather than
    a guess: an unlisted spelling still ranks UNPRIORITISED, same as always. Checked case-
    insensitively, after the label-prefix strip, and ONLY when the literal P0-P4 match already
    failed — a literal tier ALWAYS wins over any alias, full stop, even one whose key happens to
    collide with a real tier spelling (a plausible misconfiguration: an example map copy-pasted and
    only the value edited, leaving a stray `"P0": "P4"`-shaped key behind). Without this ordering,
    such a config would silently remap the meaning of every literal occurrence of that tier
    repo-wide — a far larger blast radius than the bug aliases exist to fix, and the opposite of
    what "just another spelling of a tier" is supposed to mean. Omitting `aliases` (the default) is

    """The PROMOTED rank for a blocker, given the rank and pickability of every issue it directly
    blocks (#900). Kept as a config-dict-free pure function, like the rest of this module, so the
    ranking rule is unit-testable without a goal file, a config dict, or a blocking graph.

    `own_rank` is the blocker's own current rank (whatever `priority_rank` returned for it -- this
    function has no opinion on where the rank came from, only that lower means more urgent). `mode`
    is the already-resolved `discovery.blocker_promotion.mode` value -- see BLOCKER_PROMOTION_MODES.
    `dependents` is an iterable of `(dependent_rank, has_other_unblocked_work)` pairs, one per issue
    this blocker directly blocks:
      - `dependent_rank` is that dependent's own rank.
      - `has_other_unblocked_work` is whether the dependent ALSO has other unblocked/pickable work
        sitting at its own tier already -- i.e. promoting this blocker would not change what the loop
        picks next for that dependent's tier, so "smart" mode has nothing to gain by promoting on
        that dependent's account.

    Mode semantics:
      - "off" (default; also the fallback for any unrecognised or missing mode -- fail safe, not fail
        loud, matching this module's existing conservative-default posture): `own_rank` unchanged.
        Callers should typically skip calling this at all when mode is "off", to keep that path as
        cheap and obviously-correct as possible -- this branch exists so a defensive caller never
        NEEDS to skip it.
      - "always": the minimum (most urgent) rank among `own_rank` and every dependent's rank. When
        every dependent ranks at or behind `own_rank` already, that minimum IS `own_rank`, so nothing
        changes -- "if no dependent is more urgent, return own_rank unchanged" falls out of `min()`
        rather than needing its own branch.
      - "smart": the same `min()` computation as "always", but a dependent only enters the pool when
        its `has_other_unblocked_work` is False. A dependent with other pickable work at its own tier
        is excluded ENTIRELY from consideration for this evaluation -- not merely capped -- so a
        highly urgent but ineligible dependent cannot pull the blocker's rank at all, even partway.

    Multi-dependent tie-break, "always" and "smart" alike: the minimum rank among the eligible
    candidates wins. No further tie-break logic is needed -- a lower rank is unconditionally more
    urgent no matter how many dependents share it or which one happens to be listed first.

    ONE LEVEL ONLY, BY DESIGN: this function looks at a single blocker and its DIRECTLY-blocked
    dependents. It does not walk a blocking graph, and it is not this function's job to. A transitive
    chain (A blocked by B blocked by C) propagates correctly when the CALLER walks outward from the
    most-blocked issue and calls this function once per edge, feeding one level's returned rank in as
    the next level's `own_rank` -- e.g. compute B's promoted rank from A first, then compute C's
    promoted rank using B's *promoted* (not original) rank as C's dependent-rank input. Building that
    walk -- plus resolving `discovery.blocker_promotion.mode` from config and writing the promoted
    rank back out -- belongs in sources.py, a different slice; this function is only the one-level
    ranking rule that walk will call once per edge.
