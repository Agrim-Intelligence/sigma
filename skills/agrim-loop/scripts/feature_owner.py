"""Ownership enforcement -- who may file work against a unit (#1479, epic #1464, story #1427).

THE FACT THIS MODULE EXISTS TO CHANGE. `feature_registry.is_authorized` was defined in #1469,
recorded in `index.json`, rendered into `<name>.md`'s managed block by #1470 -- and called by
NOTHING. Twelve goals of this epic shipped the machinery around a grant that nothing enforced, and
`docs/branching-model.md` §12 SAID so in as many words: "No shipped code path refuses anything on
the strength of it." This is the code path, and shipping it is what deleted that sentence.

TWO OWNERS, TWO DIFFERENT QUESTIONS, BOTH REQUIRED (§12):

    entry.owner                 WHO OWNS THE UNIT -- its scope, its tags, its ledger chain,
                                whether it is still open.
    entry.repos[<repo>].owner   WHO OWNS THAT BOARD -- whether the unit may have work filed
                                against it at all. One per participating repo.

THE RULE. An issue carrying `feature:<name>` may be created DIRECTLY only by the unit owner or by
the owner of the repo it is being created in. Nobody is ever blocked from raising it: anyone else
files it as `sdlc:needs-confirmation` -- which already means "inert until its owner promotes it", so
this level adds NO new machinery to the label model -- plus a ledger entry ADDRESSED TO the owner,
so the request reaches a person rather than a board they may not be watching.

WHERE THE TWO OWNERS DISAGREE, THE BOARD OWNER WINS, AND THE MORE RESTRICTIVE GATE APPLIES. Board
ownership is authority over what becomes work in somebody's QUEUE. A unit owner deciding their unit
touches another component is a scoping call and squarely theirs; a unit owner creating a PICKABLE
issue on somebody else's board is handing them work they have not agreed to -- and an agent may pick
it up and start executing before they have seen it. So `may_file` refuses the unit owner on a board
with a different owner, and that arm (`BOARD_OWNER_WINS`) is the one this module would be wrong
without.

AUTHORISATION IS PER UNIT, NOT PER ISSUE. A board owner grants once
(`repos.<repo>.authorized = true`) and from then on EVERY issue under that unit is authorised,
including the follow-ups Sigma files itself. Per-issue approval was considered and rejected
upstream: on a boundary unit it means promoting essentially every goal forever, which converts a
real guarantee into a rubber stamp -- and a gate that is always said yes to stops being read.
ABSENT MEANS FALSE. Revoking stops FUTURE issues only; nothing here ever revisits what is filed.

THIS LEVEL NEVER WRITES `authorized`, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE RATHER THAN UNFINISHED. A grant a
machine can mint is not a grant. `authorized` moves only by a human editing the registry, exactly as
§12 specifies, which is also why there is no `grant` verb on the CLI below.

TWO LAYERS, FOR #1477'S REASON AND NOT A DIFFERENT ONE. `feature_propagate` learned that one gate is
never enough here, because the layers are reached by different callers:

  - `gate_at_filing` refuses at the moment the kit OPENS an issue (`handoff.create_tracked_issue`,
    the one place that ever does). It defends a board against Sigma itself, and it is reached by
    the loop, by `handoff.py open/track`, by retro, by decompose -- every path that files.
    IT IS ASKED ABOUT THE UNIT THE ISSUE WILL DECLARE, NOT THE ONE IT INHERITED, and the two differ
    on the path that matters: a caller-supplied `feature:<name>` label survives
    `feature_stamp.reconcile_labels` while the inherited unit becomes None, so an issue is created
    declaring a unit that the inherited value does not name. Gating on the inherited value alone
    let `handoff track --label feature:<x>` file directly-actionable work under a stranger's unit
    with no check, no warning and nobody told. `feature_stamp.declared_units` is the one answer to
    "what will this issue carry", and the caller applies this gate to every unit it returns.
  - `gate_at_pick` refuses at the moment the loop PICKS an issue somebody else already filed. It
    defends a board against every issue that never went through this kit at all: a human's
    `gh issue create --label feature:x`, another tool's, another repo's automation.

Neither alone is enough. The filing gate cannot see an issue it did not file; the pick gate cannot
un-create one. Together they cover both directions of the same sentence.

THE INFERENCE, AND IT IS THE ONLY ONE IN THE MODEL. An owner is DECLARED; failing that, the first
person to work a goal on the unit becomes owner, once, and it is changed thereafter only by editing
the registry. No reassignment on inactivity, no transfer to whoever picks up next: an owner
reassignable by whoever happens to pick up work next is not an owner, it is a lease. `claim` is
therefore guarded on ABSENCE, never on staleness, and `claim_at_pick` runs it inside `feature_sync`'s
per-unit lock so two first picks cannot both be first. It fires from ONE place -- `gate_at_pick`,
on the login that opened the goal being picked -- and `_claim_here` records why that site and no
other: the name has to come from GitHub, and that is the one point on the path where one is already
in hand at no extra cost.

IT IS ASKED PER FIELD, NOT PER ENTRY, AND #1575 IS THE WHOLE OF THAT SENTENCE. The two owners above
are two different facts, so "does this unit need an owner inferred" has two answers and the gate has
to ask the one it is about. It used to reach the inference only on `may_file`'s `NO_OWNER` arm --
NEITHER owner recorded -- which is unreachable the moment either is. A PROPAGATED entry is exactly
that shape: `feature_propagate` copies the whole entry into the sibling, unit owner included, so the
sibling's actor-free pass answers `NO_ACTOR` rather than `NO_OWNER` and the sibling never records
`repos.<repo>.owner` of its own. Every issue in the sibling that the foreign owner did not open was
then held, permanently, for a person in a different repository who may not know the unit reached
this one -- a refusal with no local remedy at all. So the board half is inferred on its own
condition (`_claimable_board`), and the entry is re-read afterwards so the verdict is answered
against what actually landed. `claim`'s per-field absence guard is what makes filling one half and
not the other the ordinary case rather than a special one.

WHY THE GRANT IS ASKED THROUGH `authorized()` AND NEVER THROUGH `registry.is_authorized` DIRECTLY.
That function does an EXACT `repos.get(repo)`. #1477 then made every other slug comparison in this
subsystem CASE-INSENSITIVE (`feature_sync.same_repo`, because `Org/Repo` and `org/repo` cannot both
exist on GitHub), and made `repos` keys human-typed for the first time. Asking `is_authorized` with a
slug spelled differently from the key on disk returns False silently -- a real grant reading as
ungranted, with no error anywhere. `authorized()` resolves the key with `feature_sync.repo_key`
first, which is the same write-side rule `_record_goal` already follows. A test pins both halves.

ONE IDENTITY NAMESPACE, AND IT IS GITHUB'S. Every name compared here is a GitHub handle: `owner`
and `repos.<repo>.owner` are handles in the design's own example (`"@app-owner"`), `owners.parse`
yields handles off CODEOWNERS, and the pick gate's side of the comparison is an issue's
`author.login`. So the filing side resolves through `whoami` -- `gh api user`, or "" -- and NOT
through `ledger.actor`, whose `$USER` and `"unknown"` fallbacks are right for naming the writer of a
ledger line and wrong for every comparison in this file. See `whoami` for the three stock-install
failures that chain produced, one of which was a wrong PERMIT rather than a wrong refusal.

WHAT REMAINS OPEN, NARROWED TO WHAT IT ACTUALLY IS: a registry whose `owner` was hand-written in
some spelling other than the owner's GitHub login. That is a DECLARED value, so nothing this module
does can second-guess it, and it fails CLOSED -- the issue is held rather than filed. It is made
diagnosable instead: the flag comment prints the recorded owners and the observed author side by
side and says that correcting the registry is the fix, rather than promoting each issue forever.

THE REMEDY A REFUSAL NAMES HAS TO BE ONE THE READER CAN PERFORM (#1569), AND FOR TWO CYCLES IT WAS
NOT. Every channel here used to offer `/agrim-promote` as a way to clear the hold. It is not one:
that command swaps two labels, and `gate_at_pick` reads no label -- it recomputes from the registry
and the issue's AUTHOR, neither of which a promotion touches. So the goal came back onto the board
and the very next pick set it aside again, which is the loop-wedging shape a refusal must never
have. `feature_propagate`'s sibling gate had the ordering right from the start ("when they accept,
`<repo>` joins `repos` and this goal can be promoted") and this module said the opposite. It now
says the same thing: the two remedies are REGISTRY EDITS -- `repos.<repo>.authorized = true`, or
correcting an owner spelled two ways -- and `/agrim-promote` is the gesture that returns the goal to
the board AFTER one of them, never instead of one. `promote._refusal` refuses the promotion that
would be undone, through `would_hold`, so the no-op is caught before it is performed rather than
discovered a pick later.

AND THE SECOND CYCLE IS NOT SILENT. `_flag` is idempotent against the issue's own timeline and the
ledger note is gated on it, which was right for bounding repeated notes and wrong for this: the
operator did what the comment said, the goal was demoted again, and neither channel said a word.
Arriving at `_flag` with the marker already present is EVIDENCE OF A PROMOTION rather than of a
repeated pick -- see that function -- so it is announced as one, in its own words, once per
demotion.

THE COST, MEASURED IN CALLS RATHER THAN ASSERTED TO BE SMALL. The pick gate reads an author only
when the answer depends on one: a granted unit, an unrecorded unit and an unadopted project each
settle at zero reads, and a unit with no owner pays exactly one read ever, because the next pick
finds the owner that read established. `claim_at_pick` adds one shard read and, once per unit, one
write. #1575's board-half inference adds the same again, at most once per unit PER REPO, plus one
re-read of the registry on the pick that lands it -- after which `board_owner` answers and neither
is paid. On the FILING side `whoami` is one `gh api user`, cached per runner, so a pass that files
several issues pays it once. Nothing here touches `work.start`'s path, which still reads the issue
exactly once (#1467) -- a requirement an identity call placed there would have broken.

    DELIBERATELY NOT `ledger.actor`, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS THIS WHOLE FUNCTION'S REASON. That

    `"unknown"`, and every one of those fallbacks is right for what it does: name the writer of a
    ledger line, where a guess beats an absence. Every one of them is WRONG here, because this name
    is compared against an issue's `author.login` and against a registry `owner` field, and a guess
    in that comparison is not a weaker answer -- it is a different person. Measured, on a STOCK
    install with a transient gh failure and no override:

      - `$USER` ("alice-laptop") refuses the owner's own filing as `NOT_AN_OWNER`, and -- worse --
        `claim` would write it as the unit's permanent owner, after which every issue that person
        really opens is held at every pick, fixable only by a hand edit nobody knows to make;
      - `"unknown"` is a NAMEABLE string, so `same_actor("unknown", "unknown")` is True and any two
        accounts whose gh resolution failed become each other. That is a wrong PERMIT, and
        `actor_key`'s "two people nobody can name are not the same person" invariant -- correct, and
        pinned by its own test -- was simply defeated one layer up.

    So: gh, or nothing. "" lands on `may_file`'s `NO_ACTOR` arm, which PROCEEDS -- a gate that
    cannot say who must not refuse on their behalf -- and `claim` records nothing rather than a
    name it cannot vouch for.

    IT TAKES NO `config`, AND THE OMISSION IS THE POINT rather than an oversight: there is no
    configured value it could consult that would be more true than the authenticated account -- the
    account that will AUTHOR the issue is the one `gh` is authenticated as, whatever a config file
    calls the writer -- and a parameter it accepted but ignored would read as though there were.

    TWO NORMALISATIONS, EACH MEASURED AGAINST A REAL SPELLING IN THIS REPO RATHER THAN GUESSED AT:

      - THE LEADING `@` IS DROPPED. `docs/branching-model.md`'s own example entry writes
        `"owner": "@unit-owner"`, and `owners.parse` strips the `@` off every CODEOWNERS line
        (`tests/test_handoff.py` asserts it), so the same person arrives spelled both ways from two
        stores this module reads side by side. Comparing them raw makes one person two.
      - THE CASE IS IGNORED. GitHub logins are case-insensitively unique, exactly as repo slugs are
        (`feature_sync.same_repo`) and unit names are (`feature_registry._read_unit_file`); this
        subsystem already rules that two casings were never two things, and a third opinion here
        would be the drift those two comments exist to refuse.

    A non-string, or a string with nothing in it, is "" -- which `same_actor` then refuses to match
    against anything, INCLUDING another "". Two people nobody can name are not the same person.

    AND SO IS THE LITERAL `"unknown"`, which is the belt to `whoami`'s braces. That string is
    `ledger.actor`'s last-resort stand-in for an absent name; `whoami` exists so it never reaches
    this module through the front door, but it can still arrive from a hand-edited registry, from a
    ledger-derived value some future caller passes, or from a version of `ledger.actor` this file
    does not control. Refusing it HERE makes the invariant above true of the sentinel too, in the
    one place both sides of every comparison pass through.

    THE COST, STATED: a real GitHub account literally named `unknown` could never own a unit or be
    matched as one. That is the trade, taken knowingly -- the collision it prevents is a wrong

                        of every unit inert -- the one issue that establishes the unit at all.
      NO_SLUG           this checkout's own `owner/name` could not be resolved, so there is no BOARD
                        to ask about -- neither the grant nor the board owner can be read under a
                        repo nobody could name. Falling back to the unit owner alone would refuse a
                        pick over OUR configuration gap rather than over anybody's authority, which
                        is the one refusal nobody can act on. `feature_sync` draws the identical
                        line for its own `NO_REPO`: report the gap, record nothing, hold nothing.
      AUTHORIZED        the grant. Per unit, so it covers every issue under it forever, follow-ups
                        included, and it is checked before any owner because it is exactly the
                        decision that makes ownership stop mattering for this repo.
      NO_OWNER          nobody is recorded either way. Enforcing an owner nobody named would be this
                        module inventing an authority.
      NO_ACTOR          the creator cannot be named. A gate that cannot say WHO must not refuse.
      BOARD_OWNER       the actor owns this board. The plainest allowed case, and it is checked
                        before the unit owner so the two-owner arms below cannot reach a person who
                        is both.
      UNIT_OWNER        the actor owns the unit AND no board owner disagrees.
      BOARD_OWNER_WINS  the actor owns the unit and somebody ELSE owns the board. §12.2's ruling,
                        and the arm the whole level turns on -- see the module docstring.
      NOT_AN_OWNER      neither.

    Mutates `entry` in place and returns the field paths it filled, `[]` when it filled none --
    which is the ordinary case, on every pick after the first.

    AT MOST ONCE, AND THE GUARD IS ABSENCE. Every branch here is `if there is nothing recorded`,
    never `if what is recorded looks stale`: an owner reassignable by whoever happens to pick up
    work next is not an owner, it is a lease. A declared owner is therefore never overwritten, and
    neither is an inferred one -- once it is written, the registry is the only thing that can change
    it, by hand.

    IT NEVER CREATES A `repos` ENTRY. Claiming a board the unit does not name would widen the unit
    into a repo its owner never agreed to, through the back door #1477 closed at the front; the repo
    half is filled only where the unit already names that repo. `sync.repo_key` picks the key that
    is already there, so a second casing is never minted beside it.

    BOTH HALVES ARE FILLED, and by the same person, because at this moment they are the same fact:
    the first person to work the unit is the only evidence either field has. They diverge later
    exactly as any hand edit makes them diverge, and `may_file` is written for that divergence.

    THEY ALSO ARRIVE DIVERGED, which is #1575's case and the reason the two guards are separate `if`
    statements rather than one. A propagated entry names the unit's owner (inferred in the repo it
    came from) and no owner for the board it just landed on, so this function is called to fill the
    SECOND field only -- and it does, because each guard asks about its own field. The caller that

    -- and neither, now, can the registry edit that clears the hold, which is why it is stated

    TWO RUNNERS, TWO PARAMETERS, AND NEITHER EVER DEFAULTS TO THE OTHER. This function needs a GIT
    runner (`repo_slug`, contract `(cwd, argv) -> stdout`) and a GH runner (`whoami`, contract
    `(argv) -> stdout`). An earlier revision took ONE `run` and handed it to both, reasoning that a
    caller's injected runner should not be bypassed -- and it was not bypassed, it was MISAPPLIED.
    Measured with `discovery.github.repo` unset, which `repo_slug`'s own docstring calls the real
    install path rather than a theoretical one: a 1-arity gh runner made `repo_slug` raise on
    arity, so its git fallback was structurally dead and the verdict came back `no-slug`; a 2-arity
    git runner made `whoami` raise, and the verdict came back `no-actor`. Both of those ALLOW, so
    whichever runner a caller injected, one consumer broke silently and the gate stopped gating.
    Splitting them makes that unrepresentable rather than merely unlikely: there is no single value
    a caller can pass that reaches the wrong consumer. `handoff` has only a gh runner and passes
    only `gh_run`, which leaves `repo_slug` on `feature_sync._run` exactly as it was before either
    revision -- so the guarantee the first version stated in a comment is now held by the shape.

    WHY HERE AND NOT ON `work.start`'S PATH, which is where this began. The name this inference
    records is compared against issue authors forever after -- inference happens once -- so it has
    to come from GitHub, and `work.start` has no GitHub identity in hand. Every way of giving it one
    was worse, measured rather than assumed: `ledger.actor` invents `$USER` or the literal
    `"unknown"` (the exact hole this remediation closes); a `gh api user` of its own is a hidden
    subprocess whose answer depends on the machine, which makes the TEST SUITE's behaviour depend on
    it too; and routing that call through `start`'s injected runner breaks #1467's measured
    requirement that the pick path read the issue EXACTLY ONCE. Here the login is already in hand,
    on a read this gate makes for its own reasons, through the backlog source's own runner -- so it
    costs no new call, is in the same namespace as every later comparison by construction, and is
    exercised by the same fakes as every other pick-path write.

    WHAT IT COSTS, AND THE COST IS *WHICH PERSON*, NOT A DELAY. One `gh issue view --json author`
    per pick of a unit that has an entry and no owner -- at most once per unit, because the next
    pick finds an owner. The part that matters is the other half: the FIRST pick of a brand-new unit
    returns `NO_ENTRY` above this point (deliberately -- creating a registry entry is
    `sync_at_pick`'s job, not a gate's), so the unit is created ownerless and is named by the author
    of the SECOND goal picked onto it. Those are frequently different people, and the naming is
    once-only and hand-edit-only thereafter, so a passer-by's issue can durably own a unit somebody
    else created -- observable by exactly the person who then finds their own issues held. And
    during that window every ask addressed to `entry.owner` by `feature_propagate`, `feature_sync`,
    `unit_completion` and `feature_doc` lands unaddressed, which is worst at precisely the moment a
    new unit raises the most propagation and scope questions. "Named one pick late" undersells both;
    it is written out here so a reader budgeting for a delay is not surprised by an identity.

    THE FOURTH OPTION, COSTED RATHER THAN LEFT UNCONSIDERED, because it is the one that removes that
    cost. The author string is in hand HERE, and `work.start` runs a moment later on the same goal,
    after `sync_at_pick` has created the entry: thread the login forward and claim there, and the
    unit is named by the author of the FIRST goal, with no new gh call, no machine dependence and no
    second issue read. It is strictly better on the property this paragraph is about, and it is not
    taken in this change for one structural reason: `loop._next` returns `(kind, goal)` and nothing
    else, so carrying a value from the pick to the start means widening that seam -- a new return
    field or a state file read by `work.start` -- and `loop`->`work` currently passes only the goal
    id, on purpose. Widening it is a change to the loop's own contract, with its own blast radius
    and its own tests, and doing it inside an ownership goal would hide a seam change under a policy
    change. Filed as the follow-up; until it lands, the two costs above are the honest ones.

    A HAND-RUN `work.py start` THEREFORE NAMES NOBODY, deliberately, and that is not the two-layer
    hole it looks like: inference is a RECORD, not a defence. The field it fills is defended by
    #1477's registry-write refusal whatever reaches it, and the next loop pick names the owner.

    -> True IFF A WRITE ACTUALLY LANDED. #1575's caller re-reads the registry on that answer, so it
    has to mean the durable thing and not the attempted one: `amend` writes nothing when `claim`
    filled nothing, and a write that did not land is not evidence of a state (`feature_labels`'
    REFUSED_WRITE_FAILED rule, which this module holds everywhere else). A False here therefore
    leaves the verdict answered against the entry as it still is on disk, which is the refusal."""

    the one a human reads -- `feature_propagate._flag`'s reasoning and its honest bound: the probe is
    a read followed by a write with nothing serialising them, so two machines whose windows overlap
    can each post one comment. That costs a duplicate comment, never a wrong state.

    THE MARKER'S PRESENCE IS EVIDENCE OF A PROMOTION, NOT OF A REPEATED PICK, and that one fact is
    what turns a second comment from spam into a signal (#1569). `sources.mark_needs_confirmation`
    removes `goal_label` in the SAME atomic swap that adds `proposed_label`, and both queues then
    refuse the result -- `_fetch_pending` excludes `proposed_label` (#1392) and `_card_is_eligible`
    treats it as disqualifying -- so an issue this gate has marked is unpickable until somebody puts
    `sdlc:goal` back. Reaching this function again therefore means the goal WAS promoted and is
    being set aside a second time. It used to return False there and the ledger note was gated on
    it, so the operator performed the remedy the comment named, the goal was demoted again, and
    neither channel said a word.

    ONE COMMENT PER DEMOTION, NEVER ONE PER PICK, which is the bound the old idempotency was
    protecting and it still holds. The transient direction never reaches here (`marked` is False and
    nothing durable is written); the marked direction ends the goal's pickability. So the count is
    bounded by promotions -- a human's, or `blockers.classify`'s `PROMOTED` arm for a
    `{followup, needs-confirmation}` issue, which is the one automated promoter that can reach it
    and is itself bounded to one pair per blocker event (`feature_propagate.gate_at_pick` derives
    that path in full). An automated promoter silently undoing a human's hold is a thing worth one
    comment, not a reason to say nothing.

    CALLED INSIDE `loop._next`'S CLAIM LOCK, right after the unit label is attached and after
    #1477's scope gate -- the last moment at which nothing has acted on the goal. A refusal here is
    the cheapest possible one: no worktree, no branch, no registry write, no PR.

    IT ASKS ABOUT THE AUTHOR, NEVER ABOUT THE PICKER, and that is the difference between this gate
    and every other gate on the pick path. The rule is about who may CREATE work carrying the unit's
    label; who later picks up work that was legitimately created is a different question and this
    level does not have an opinion about it. So a stranger picking the owner's issue proceeds, and
    the owner picking a stranger's issue does not.

    THE AUTHOR READ IS PAID ONLY WHEN THE ANSWER DEPENDS ON IT. `may_file` is called first with no
    actor: a granted unit, an unowned unit, an unrecorded unit and an unadopted project each settle
    without a name, and only a unit that has an owner and no grant reaches `fetch_author`. That is
    one `gh issue view --json author` on exactly the picks the gate exists for, and none on the
    rest.

    `sdlc:needs-confirmation` STANDS ALONE (`docs/label-model.md` §2): the goal gives up membership
    and waits for a human, which is what "inert until its owner promotes it" already means
    everywhere else in this tool. It is the right label for the same reason #1477's gate uses it --
    unlike a missing label, which self-heals the moment somebody creates it, this needs a DECISION.

    THE DECISION IS A REGISTRY EDIT, AND `/agrim-promote` IS WHAT COMES AFTER IT (#1569). This
    paragraph used to end "and `/agrim-promote` is exactly the gesture that ends it", which is true of
    #1477's gate and false of this one: that command swaps two labels, and nothing below reads a
    label. Every text this gate writes now names the two registry edits that DO clear it and says
    that promoting alone does not; `would_hold` lets `promote` refuse the no-op rather than perform
    it. See the module docstring for the loop that wording produced.

    NEVER RAISES, and the totality is layered rather than promised. The detection is a registry read
    plus one issue read; the outer guard only ever covers a failure to DETECT, which PROCEEDS, since
    a gate that cannot answer must not stop a queue. Every call into `source` is guarded on its own.

    THE THREE DIRECTIONS, each chosen rather than fallen into, and each `feature_propagate`'s:

      - THE MARK LANDED       -> REFUSE, `marked` True, and NOW write the durable things: one flag
                                 comment and, gated on that comment actually having been POSTED, one
                                 ledger entry to the owner. One watermark for both -- but the
                                 watermark is the DEMOTION, not the hold (#1569): a second arrival
                                 means the goal was promoted back (`_flag` derives why), so it gets
                                 its own shorter comment and its own note saying the promotion did
                                 not clear it. The first, long text is still posted exactly once.
      - THE MARK DID NOT LAND -> REFUSE, `marked` False, and write NOTHING durable.
                                 `feature_labels`' REFUSED_WRITE_FAILED rule verbatim: a write that
                                 did not land is not evidence of a state, so nothing may claim one,
                                 and a network blip must not summon a human. It also bounds the
                                 noise -- the goal keeps `sdlc:goal`, so it is re-picked, and a note
                                 written here would be written again every pick until it cleared.
      - THE SOURCE HAS NO SURFACE -> PROCEED. `LocalSource` has none of these methods and no
                                 repository label namespace at all; refusing forever with no way to
                                 signal is the "issue nobody can find" this codebase never converges
                                 on. A local backlog has no author to read either, so there is
                                 nothing this gate could have measured.

    ONE HONEST GAP IN THAT TABLE, AND IT IS A SHARED SHAPE RATHER THAN A ONE-OFF: on the FIRST
    direction, if the label write lands and the comment then fails, nothing is written and nobody is
    told -- and unlike the second direction there is no next pick to retry on, because `sdlc:goal`
    is already gone. The stderr line `_flag` prints ("the next pick retries it") is inherited from
    `feature_propagate.gate_at_pick`, WHICH HAS THIS EXACT SHAPE AND IS ALREADY MERGED, and whose
    reasoning holds only on the `not marked` path. That is why it is named here rather than fixed
    here: the coupling exists to bound REPEATED notes across picks, on the marked path there are no
    further picks, and decoupling it (`if marked: _tell(...)`, with the comment as only its own
    watermark) is a change both call sites want or neither should get. Filing it against both is the
    right move; fixing one and leaving its twin is how two spellings of one rule start.

    THE RESIDUE THIS GATE INHERITS RATHER THAN INTRODUCES, named because `feature_propagate`'s
    docstring handed the decision here: `blockers.classify` returns `PROMOTED` for an issue carrying
    BOTH `sdlc:followup` and `sdlc:needs-confirmation`, so something naming a goal held here as a
    blocker can promote it back out. It is bounded the same way (the promotion fires on a blocker
    event, not on every pick, and the goal ends each cycle inert), and closing it needs a signal
    `classify` can SEE -- it reads labels alone, and neither gate's flag comment is one. This goal
    deliberately does NOT add that signal: a new label in the `sdlc:*` namespace is a change to the
    contract in `docs/label-model.md` that every adopter's board would have to learn, made on behalf
    of a path that ends inert either way. It is recorded in §2b-iii instead, where the next person
    to widen that row will read it."""

    THE SAME QUESTION `gate_at_pick` ASKS, WITHOUT THE SOURCE AND WITHOUT THE WRITES, so `promote`
    can refuse a promotion the very next pick would undo instead of performing it as a no-op
    (#1569). It exists rather than a second copy of the policy in that module for the reason
    `refusal_clause` exists: this file has already paid twice for the same fact being written out in
    a second place.

    IT MUST FAIL OPEN AND IT DOES, on every axis. A project that has not adopted the model, a unit
    the registry does not name, an author nobody could read, a registry that could not be read at
    all: each answers None, because a WRONG refusal inside `/agrim-promote` is the dead end that
    command exists to remove, while a missing one costs only the behaviour that shipped before this.

    IT ACCOUNTS FOR THE INFERENCE, WHICH IS WHY IT IS NOT SIMPLY `may_file`. A pick with a claimable
    board (#1575) names this repo's board owner from the author and then permits them, so answering
    on the registry as it stands today would refuse a promotion that the pick allows -- the exact
    false refusal this function is here to prevent. `_claimable_board` is the one predicate both
    sides ask.

    IT READS NO NETWORK. `repo_slug` prefers `discovery.github.repo` and falls back to the local git
    remote; everything else is a registry read. The author is handed IN, by a caller that already
    had the issue open."""
