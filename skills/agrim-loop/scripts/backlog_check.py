"""Pre-work backlog cross-check (0.9.21) — the LLM-free stage-1 retrieval that, given a just-picked
goal, surfaces likely DUPLICATES / BLOCKERS / OBSOLETE-BY-completed-work against the rest of the
backlog + in-flight team work, so the loop doesn't spend a full Research/Plan cycle on redundant work.

Zero LLM tokens: a stdlib TF-IDF cosine over a candidate set of issues that share ≥1 term with the goal
(rarity then drives the SCORE via idf, not membership) — exact at a few-hundred-issue scale, no
MinHash/LSH needed — plus an explicit `#N`-reference graph and the team
ledger. It EMITS EVIDENCE, renders no verdict and takes no action — a later slice's loop hook decides
whether to park-with-proof or annotate, and only THAT stage may (optionally) hand the top-K flagged
pairs to an LLM. The lexical index is cheap enough to rebuild each run, so nothing is persisted here;
the incremental cache belongs to the embedding layer (0.9.23), and its entries are keyed by embedder
identity as well as content (#542) — see `_dense_channel`.

Corpus: github mode → the gitignored board mirror (mirror.read_mirror); local mode → the goal files.
Completed work → closed mirror issues (velocity-scaled window) or local `status: done` goals.

SECRET-SAFE: findings carry issue refs + shared index TERMS (scrubbed, capped) — never a title/body/
secret. FAIL-OPEN: no corpus / no git / any error → an empty pack with a machine-readable `degraded[]`,
never a raise (a later slice calls this on the pick hot-path).

A human who reviews a parked, confident finding and rules it a false positive can dismiss that EXACT
(kind, ref) finding so a retry doesn't re-park on it identically — post `dismiss_comment(kind, ref)`
as a comment (via `loop.py note`); see `DISMISS_MARKER` / `_dismissed_findings` (#830). GitHub mode
ONLY: local goal files have no comment thread to read a dismissal back from, so local-mode discovery
surfaces an explicit `degraded` flag instead of silently no-op'ing — see `_local_dismissal_flag`.

# EVERY issue the kit ever opens on its own behalf (a hand-off, a same-area follow-up, a queued
# finding), plus the default title `create_tracked_issue()` / `hand_off()` fall back to when no
# caller supplies one. Two such issues describing genuinely UNRELATED work were measured at 0.825+
# cosine on that shared prose ALONE -- enough by itself to clear `park_threshold` (0.80, the shipped
# default) and auto-park a goal against a "duplicate" that shares nothing but the kit's own wording;
# the more disciplined the template, the worse this gets, since every line it adds is one MORE term
# every tracked issue now shares with every other one.
#
# The fix is to strip it, not down-weight it with a stopword list: it is *exactly* known, because
# this codebase generates it. Each pattern below mirrors one fixed span of `handoff.issue_body()` /
# `handoff._tracked_issue_body()` / their default title format, verbatim. `**What is needed:** ` (and
# no other line) strips only the LABEL, never the free text after it -- that text is the one part of
# either template holding actual, discriminating content (the `why` a caller supplied), and it has to
# survive so a genuine duplicate -- two issues that really do describe the same "why" -- still scores
# well above the parking line once the shared boilerplate around it is gone (pinned in both
# directions by `tests/test_backlog_check.py`).
#
# Deliberately NOT imported from `handoff.py` (unlike `_strip_offboard_prefixes`'s reuse of
# `sources.OFFBOARD_COMMENT_PREFIXES` above): those fixed spans live inline inside f-string list
# builders there, not as standalone constants, and lifting them out is a bigger touch to that
# module's own template functions than this fix calls for. What keeps this from silently drifting
# out of step is the test suite calling the REAL `handoff.issue_body()` / `_tracked_issue_body()`
# functions rather than hand-typed copies of their prose -- a future wording change there that this
# list stops covering shows up as the stripped score creeping back up, not as a silent miss.

# trace -- so the NEXT cross_check recomputes the identical (kind, ref) finding from the identical
# corpus text and re-parks it, forever, until the underlying text happens to change.
#
# Convention chosen to match the CLOSEST existing "a human/loop already handled this" precedent in
# this codebase, `decompose_goal.DECOMPOSE_FILED_MARKER` (loop.py's `file`-mode idempotency check):
# an HTML-comment marker POSTED AS A COMMENT (never the body -- same reasoning `append_to_body`'s own
# docstring gives for why a body rewrite is a far more invasive ask than "leave a comment"), read back
# as a bare substring/regex scan over the goal's own comment text -- comments have no "first line is a
# declaration" convention to anchor to, exactly like DECOMPOSE_FILED_MARKER's own docstring reasons.
# NOT `blocker_promotion`'s explanatory-comment convention (sources.py `_write_blocker_promotion`'s
# plain-prose audit trail): that exists for a one-way-ratchet write with nothing to re-derive on a
# later run, so it has no machine-checked marker at all -- the opposite of what #830 needs, which is
# specifically to change what a LATER run computes. NOT agrim-scope's dedup-hit-as-a-question
# convention either: that is a synchronous, conversational brainstorm-time flow with a human on the
# other end of the turn; `precheck` runs unattended inside the autonomous loop with no chat turn to
# ask a question in.
#
# Reused, not fetched again: `raw_comments` (cross_check, below) is the SAME list already fetched for
# `_explicit_blockers`'s `comment_text` a few lines up (via `_fetch_scrubbed_comments`) -- one
# bounded, single-issue fetch serves both the explicit-blocker regex and the dismissal scan, so this
# feature adds zero new `gh` calls to precheck's hot path. The dismissal scan reads the RAW list
# directly (unfiltered, uncapped), not the derived `comment_text`: `comment_text` is capped at
# `mirror._EXCERPT_CHARS` and has any dismissal-marker-bearing comment filtered OUT (see
# `_filter_dismissal_comments`) -- exactly the text `_explicit_blockers` should scan for NEW blocker
# phrases, and exactly the text the marker scan must NOT use, since either transformation could hide
# the very marker this scan exists to find (#830 findings 3 and 4).
#
# GitHub mode ONLY (#830 finding 1): the read-back above is entirely comment-shaped, and local goal
# files have no comment thread at all -- `_fetch_scrubbed_comments` already no-ops there by
# construction (github-only, like `_goal_comment_text` before it). A parallel local-mode mechanism
# (e.g. reading LocalSource's own `.sdlc/journey/<stem>.md` journal, which `loop.py note` already
# writes to correctly in local mode -- only the READ side was ever missing) was considered and
# rejected for THIS fix: every non-explicit finding kind's `ref` in local mode is a full goal-file
# PATH (`_build_corpus`'s local branch), never the bare issue number `_DISMISS_RE`'s `ref=(\d+)`
# marker format requires, so safely matching a local marker back to the exact finding it names is a
# materially bigger change than "add a read" -- scoped out. `_local_dismissal_flag` below instead
# turns the restriction LOUD rather than silent: a journal entry carrying the marker is detected
# (cheap -- noticing it exists needs none of the ref-matching machinery above) and surfaced as an
# explicit `degraded` flag + park/advisory note (`decide`, further down), so a local-mode operator
# who dismisses a finding sees "not applied" on the very next park instead of silence. This mirrors
# the established precedent for this exact category of problem elsewhere in this codebase (`loop.py`
# `decompose_check`, `mode == "file"`: a local source lacks a comment timeline to read an idempotency
# marker back from, so it degrades to a visible, explained park rather than a silent skip).
#
# Keyed on (kind, ref) -- the SAME pair `_dedup_sort` already treats as a finding's own identity a
# few screens down -- deliberately NOT a hash of the full finding (score/evidence drift run to run as
# the corpus's idf recomputes, e.g. merely because an unrelated issue closed elsewhere; a hash keyed
# on those would silently stop matching the very next run and defeat the whole feature) and
# deliberately NOT scoped to any one finding SOURCE (explicit-blocker regex vs. TF-IDF similarity vs.
# a ledger hand-off): a human saying "the blocked-by-821 finding on this goal is wrong" means exactly
# that, whichever channel re-derives it.
#
# Downgrades `confident` only -- never removes the finding -- mirroring the #521 decomposition-
# `exempt` treatment above exactly: the module's own contract is "evidence, never a verdict" (module
# docstring, top of file), so a dismissed finding stays visible (advisory) rather than vanishing; if
# the human's dismissal was itself wrong, the evidence is still there to be reconsidered, just no

    #624: the on-disk cache is BOUNDED two ways, both applied on write only (a read-only / fully-
    cached run never touches disk, so a same-identity cache HIT stays exactly as free as before —
    the #584 bar: repeated runs cost zero re-embeds).
    (1) Identity-scoped: the file stores ONE `identity` alongside its `vectors`; a write under a
        DIFFERENT identity (a provider/model swap) discards the previous generation WHOLESALE rather
        than appending alongside it. Those old entries would never be looked up again anyway — their
        hash key was computed under the old identity, so a same-text lookup under the new identity
        always misses — #542 already made a swap self-invalidating; this just stops the now-dead
        entries from sitting in the file forever. Trade-off, deliberate: the #584 review praised that
        swapping BACK to a previously-used identity came back cache-warm (no re-embed) purely as a
        side effect of the old flat, unbounded cache never dropping anything. That side effect is
        SACRIFICED here — swap-back now re-embeds like any other fresh identity — because letting the
        file grow without bound across every identity a project has ever tried is the worse default.
    (2) Capped: even ONE identity's own entries are evicted OLDEST-FIRST (by insertion order — a
        cache HIT never moves an existing key, so this is "oldest ever written", not
        least-recently-used) once they exceed `_EMBED_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES`, so an actively-edited corpus
        (every edit mints a new hash key; the stale text's old entry is never looked up again either)
        cannot grow the file unboundedly within a single identity either. The cap must exceed the
        working corpus, though: once the corpus is bigger than `_EMBED_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES`, the
        overflow (`corpus − cap` documents) re-embeds on every single `cross_check` instead of ever
        converging, so raise the cap rather than let an oversized corpus thrash forever."""
