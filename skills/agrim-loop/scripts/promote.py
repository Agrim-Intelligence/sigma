"""promote.py (#1392) -- the ONE sanctioned way to move an issue across the human approval gate.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `sdlc:needs-confirmation` (`handoff.PROPOSED_LABEL`, #233) is the approval gate:
an issue Sigma filed itself carries it and deliberately does NOT carry `sdlc:goal`, so no loop
can pick it until a human says so. The approval gesture is REMOVING that label -- but nothing ever
said so out loud, and the intuitive gesture in the GitHub UI is the opposite one: ADD `sdlc:goal`.
Do that and the issue carries BOTH, which is not a state the model has a name for.

That half-promoted state used to be read two different ways by the same release:

  - `_card_is_eligible` (the board path) treats `proposed_label` as disqualifying -- card skipped.
  - `_fetch_pending` (the label path) never checked it at all -- issue picked.

Same repo, same issue, opposite answers, decided by nothing more than which `queue_source` the
config happens to use. `_fetch_pending` now excludes it too (#1392), which makes the two agree and
makes the label mean what it says -- and makes THIS module the way across, because a human doing it
by hand still has to get two labels right in the right order against an API that does not offer
transactions. `apply` is one atomic swap; `list` finds everything already stuck.

THREE BUCKETS, and the second one is the interesting one:

  awaiting    -- open, carries `proposed_label`, no `goal_label`. The ordinary approval queue.
  deadlocked  -- open, carries `blocking_label`, no `goal_label`. Something else is BLOCKED on this
                 issue, and no queue can serve it: `_blocking_priority_pending` reuses
                 `_fetch_pending`, which always prepends `--label goal_label`, and `gh issue list
                 --label` ANDs -- so `sdlc:blocking` is a TIE-BREAK among already-eligible issues,
                 never a queue of its own. A blocker without `goal_label` is therefore unreachable,
                 while `auto_unpark` refuses to resume whatever it blocks until it CLOSES. Nothing
                 breaks that cycle on its own. Surfacing it is the fix; auto-promoting it is not
                 (it is frequently the very proposal a human is supposed to approve first).
  drift       -- open, carries BOTH `goal_label` and `proposed_label`. The half-promoted state
                 above, already on the board. Repair is a single removal.

A PROMOTION THAT THE NEXT PICK WOULD UNDO IS REFUSED, NOT PERFORMED (#1569). The two
branching-model gates hand a goal to a human by writing `proposed_label`, which makes this command
the gesture that comes next -- and neither of them reads a label, so promoting one of their issues
without first editing the registry returns it to the board for exactly one pick. The operator paid a
full cycle to find that out, and the ownership gate's own text used to send them round it. Both
questions are now asked before the swap, each through its own gate's predicate (`_feature_hold`),
and the refusal names the registry edit that actually ends the hold.

NEVER AUTO-ANYTHING. Every verb here is human-invoked and synchronous, so unlike the autonomous
lifecycle transitions in `sources.py` it uses `_swap_labels` (which RAISES) rather than
`_swap_labels_best_effort` (which swallows): a human who typed a command is owed the truth about
whether it landed. A failure on one issue is reported and the rest continue -- `apply_actions`'
posture, not an abort.

THE BOARD CARD IS NOT OPTIONAL. #1391 step 4's lesson, learned the expensive way: fixing the label
and leaving the card where it sits manufactures a permanently-unpickable goal on a board-
authoritative repo -- correctly labelled, invisible to `_board_queue` forever. Every promotion
moves the card to the `ready` column and checks `_set_board_status`' honest bool.

EVERY NAMED BLOCKER MUST BE CLOSED, NOT JUST THE FIRST ONE MENTIONED (#1888). A real batch promoted
by hand one night used a check that only ever looked at an issue's FIRST `Blocked by:` line -- 5 of
12 issues were wrongly promoted because a SECOND, still-open blocker on each was never seen (one
case: a sibling issue in the very same batch that had only just been promoted, not actually closed).
`apply` now parses EVERY `Blocked by:`/`depends on`/`depends upon` reference a body names (reusing
`blocker_scan.extract_refs`, the same whole-body scanner `mirror.py` and the pick-time dependency
gate already read blockers off of) and refuses unless every one is a LIVE, confirmed CLOSED issue --
never "carries `sdlc:goal`", never "not carrying `sdlc:needs-confirmation`", and never
`blockers.classify`'s adjacent `PICKABLE` verdict, which answers a different question (see
`_blocker_status`'s own docstring). `list` shows which rows declare a blocker at all, at zero extra
`gh` cost; only `apply` (and its `--dry-run`) ever live-verifies what one resolves to.

    structural instead of a habit.

    `.search`) that `mirror.py` and the pick-time dependency gate (`loop._pick_dependency_hold`)

    DO NOT reuse `blockers.classify`/`blockers.verdict_for` here, even though they look adjacent --
    `classify` special-cases `closed` to `STALE` before it ever reaches the `PICKABLE` branch, so
    the two verdicts cannot literally co-occur, but `PICKABLE` still answers a different question
    than this check needs: it fires the moment a blocker carries `goal_label` and is not (yet)
    closed -- "is this blocker now eligible to be picked", for a goal that may still be mid-work --

    WHY A PROMOTION NEEDS TO ASK THIS AT ALL. Both branching-model pick gates hand a goal to a human
    by writing `proposed_label`, which makes `/agrim-promote` the gesture that comes next -- and
    neither gate reads a label. `feature_owner.gate_at_pick` recomputes from the registry and the
    issue's author; `feature_propagate.gate_at_pick` recomputes from the registry and this repo's
    slug. A promotion changes neither input, so promoting one of those issues without first editing
    the registry puts it back on the board for exactly one pick. That is a no-op the operator pays a
    full cycle to discover, and the loop it produced is what #1569 records. Refusing it here is the
    same move `_refusal` already makes for a park: name the route, do not perform the dead end.

    IT ASKS EACH GATE THROUGH THAT GATE'S OWN PREDICATE, never through a copy of its policy.
    `feature_owner.would_hold` is the ownership question asked without the writes (it accounts for
    the board-owner inference a pick would perform, so this never refuses a promotion the pick would
    have allowed); `feature_sync.is_scope_expansion` is the scope question, and its docstring is
    explicit that it is one definition with more than one caller.

    IT REPRODUCES EVERY ARM THE SCOPE GATE HAS. This paragraph used to record one it did not: #1568
    briefly taught the gate to ask the REMOTE whether a unit with no local entry already had a
    branch, and to hold the goal when it did, which was a network call this command had no other
    reason to make. THAT ARM WAS WITHDRAWN (#1645) -- §14's own adoption order pushes the branch
    first and declares the unit last, so "live branch, no entry" is the state of every brand-new
    unit's first pick, and the arm refused every first adoption. The two are now the same answer to
    the same question. Measured, on a registry that is adopted and records nothing under `voice`,
    with `feature/voice` live on the remote:

        feature_propagate.gate_at_pick -> Gate(proceed=True, outcome='no-entry'), zero calls made
        promote._scope_expansion       -> None

    Kept as prose rather than deleted because the shape of the mistake is the useful part: no local
    evidence separates a brand-new unit from an unlisted one, so a promotion cannot refuse on that
    input either, and reaching for the only remote fact to hand is what produced an arm that blocked
    all adoption.
