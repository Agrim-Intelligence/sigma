"""Park-&-continue loop driver. run_loop ties the backlog source + run_goal + state; start/next/record are
the agent's CLI hooks into the same primitives. Budgets (all per-run, reset each invocation):
max_iterations bounds admitted goals in one loop session; max_minutes enforces by wall-clock from the run's
start; max_tokens enforces against the host-REPORTED spend counter (`loop.py spend <dir> <n>` — the
loop never measures spend itself; no reports == no enforcement). An absent/zero key enforces nothing
for any of the three, so a config without it behaves exactly as before. The irreversible-action gate
is enforced by /agrim-loop SKILL.md prose. Claim and outcome are mirrored to the team ledger
(ledger.py) when `ledger.enabled` is on — every such call is fail-open, so a ledger problem can never
stop a run."""

    THE COMMON CASE COSTS ONE LOCAL `git status`. `sync.pending_entry_count` is the only call made
    once the backlog is at or below `threshold`, and this returns immediately after it.

    THE COOLDOWN, once above threshold. `_ledger_delivery_cooldown_path`'s mtime bounds every real

    run dispatching many triggers cannot turn this into a repeatedly-hanging synchronous publish or
    a flooded stderr (plan-review finding 2). An absent marker (never attempted) proceeds
    immediately, the same "no heartbeat yet" reading `watcher_liveness` gives its own marker.

    THE LIVENESS GATE, once past cooldown. Defers to a genuinely live watcher rather than racing
    it for the ledger worktree's git index lock -- the SAME reason `publish_after_write` already
    gives for the identical check -- but a live watcher is not automatically reported as benign:
    plan-review finding 3 is exactly a live, ticking watcher whose publishes keep failing, so a
    backlog still above threshold once the cooldown elapses is reported even then, naming the
    watcher as context rather than as an all-clear.

    ONE CLEAR STDERR LINE on any non-benign outcome, naming the real entry count and pointing at
    `/agrim-doctor` -- including `sync.publish`'s own `"nothing to publish"`, which plan-review
    finding 1 established is not always benign: `publish()` only ever commits+pushes files newly
    staged by THIS call, so a clone already holding an earlier commit that failed to push reports
    "nothing to publish" (nothing NEW to stage) while that earlier commit sits there unpushed --

    is the exclusive winner, right now, of the local race to claim `goal` (F10.5-2/#387) — `None` if
    a live sibling already holds it (caller should skip this goal), or `_LOCK_UNAVAILABLE` if the
    mechanism itself could not be used at all (fail-open; see below). Closes what the ledger-claim
    check (`_lease`/`ledger.claim_belongs_to_me`, #374) structurally cannot: #374 is entirely about
    correctly INTERPRETING a claim that already exists — it has no answer for "nothing exists yet and
    two readers look at the same instant." Two processes sharing one `.sdlc` directory (two tabs on
    one machine) racing `_next()` close enough together both read the same pre-claim ledger state and
    could otherwise both proceed.

    `flock(fd, LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)` is kernel-mediated, not built out of ordinary file operations — it
    has NO read-then-act gap of its own for a second caller to land in. Two prior schemes here, each
    built from ordinary create/rename/unlink calls plus a staleness timeout to recover a crashed
    holder's lock, were independently broken across two review cycles: `unlink()`-then-recreate let a
    second racer silently clobber the first's fresh lock; a rename-then-verify-then-restore
    refinement closed that gap but opened a narrower one, where a THIRD caller could land in the
    restore step's own window and also win. `flock` has no such window to begin with — the kernel
    either grants exclusive access to this open file description or it doesn't, atomically — and,
    the property that also retires the staleness-timeout idea those schemes needed entirely: it is
    released the INSTANT the holding process ends for ANY reason, crash included, because the kernel
    closes every fd a dying process held. A lock file surviving on disk after a crash is therefore
    never ambiguous — nothing is still flocking it, so the very next attempt against it succeeds
    immediately. No age to guess at, no eviction to arbitrate, no restore step to have its own gap.

    Deliberately LOCAL-only (this file, this machine) — cross-machine claims are the ledger's own,
    already-correct job; a lock file two different machines don't share cannot and need not arbitrate
    between them. POSIX-only (`fcntl.flock`): on a platform without `fcntl` (Windows), this fails
    open unconditionally, exactly as if this whole file didn't exist — no narrower than before #387,
    just not ALSO narrowed by it there; a `msvcrt`-based Windows equivalent is not attempted here, it
    would need its own from-scratch verification this change cannot give it.

    Fail-open beyond that: any OS error this function cannot interpret (permissions, a read-only
    filesystem, a directory it cannot create) returns `_LOCK_UNAVAILABLE` — a lock this call cannot
    manage must never be what stops the loop; `_lease`/`claim_belongs_to_me` remains the primary,
    always-on defense regardless of whether this local, best-effort narrowing is available at all.

    #494: on a WINNING acquisition, also stamps the file with this process's own pid (see
    `_write_claim_lock_liveness`) — the file used to stay at 0 bytes forever, giving a reader with
    no way to re-attempt the flock themselves (a human, a different tool) nothing to tell "claimed
    and abandoned" from "claimed and working." The stamp never affects whether this call itself
    succeeds. THIS process's own pid is always the short-lived `next`/`next-batch` CLI invocation
    doing the claiming, not any long-lived worker — see `claim_lock_alive` for why the read side
    deliberately does not treat that pid's own liveness as the signal for whether the GOAL is

    ONE DECLARATION HAD TWO READERS ON TWO TRANSPORTS, and that is the whole defect. `attach_at_pick`
    resolves the unit over GRAPHQL (`gh issue view --json body,labels`); three lines further down
    `work._declared_unit` resolves THE SAME DECLARATION over REST and bases the goal on
    `feature/<unit>`. A failed GraphQL read degrades to `UNREADABLE`/`unit=None` -- correctly, since
    a read we could not make is not evidence of anything -- but that None was then handed to the
    gates as if it were an ANSWER. So one un-retried `gh issue view` cut the goal from the unit's
    branch while the gate governing work against that unit had been told there is no unit.

    WHAT MAKES IT SHARP, AND WHAT THIS FIXES, IS NOT THE FALLBACK ITSELF: the scope gate's entire
    decision is LOCAL -- the registry on disk plus this repo's own slug -- and it was being switched
    off by a REMOTE failure, purely because its input happened to travel the failing transport. A
    gate may fail open on its own inputs; it must not fail open on somebody else's.

    ONLY `UNREADABLE`, and that boundary is the load-bearing one. Every other outcome carries an
    ANSWER: `NOTHING_TO_DO` means the read succeeded and found no declaration, `CONFLICT_DECLARED`
    means the body won and the body is what base resolution reads too, and a refusal never reaches a
    gate at all. Re-reading on any of those would tax a project that declares nothing -- the exact
    adoption promise `feature_labels`' failure table makes -- to answer a question already answered.

    ONLY WHEN `.sdlc/features/` EXISTS, for the same reason. Without it BOTH gates and #1472's
    landing check return `not-adopted` without ever looking at the unit, so resolving one would be
    pure cost paid by every project that never adopted the branching model. That check is a `stat`,
    and it is what keeps a non-adopter's pick byte-identical -- same calls, same order, same output.

    WHAT IT COSTS, MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSERTED. Nothing on the ordinary pick: a read that answered
    consults nobody. On the one whose read failed, one `gh api repos/<slug>/issues/<n>` -- REST,
    which is the point. GitHub meters REST on a SEPARATE hourly budget from GraphQL (`work.py`'s own
    measurement, and #1209's outage), so the transport that just failed is not the transport being
    asked, which is what makes a second attempt worth making at all rather than a retry of the same
    call under a different name. It is also the read `_check_cross_repo_at_pick` makes moments later
    on this same pick, so on a REFUSED pick the total is unchanged and on a proceeding one it is one
    more than before -- never per candidate, only per candidate whose declaration could not be read.

    THE RESIDUE, NAMED RATHER THAN LEFT TO BE FOUND: if the REST read fails too, there is no unit to
    hand anybody and the gates degrade exactly as they did before this existed. That is TWO
    transport failures, not one, and the alternative -- refusing the pick -- would hand every
    adopter a hard dependency on a network call that a queue must be able to survive. It stays
    fail-open, and says so on stderr.

    NEVER RAISES. This runs inside `_next`'s claim lock, above the `try/finally` that releases it, so
    an exception escaping here would leak the lock and leave the goal unpickable by anyone. The
    `getattr` on `outcome` is part of that totality rather than defensive noise: a `Decision` is a
    namedtuple, but a partial stand-in is exactly the shape a caller substitutes, and an

    no longer needs `_PROSE_ONLY_ALLOWLIST` once this call exists (verified against that checker
    before this landed).

    Gated FIRST on `model_selection == "auto"` -- a repo that has not opted in must not pay for a
    real `gh` API call (`fetch_title_body`, in github mode) or a subprocess spawn on every single
    pick, matching this project's own SAFETY property ("nothing spawns background processes, sends
    data, or consumes quota without the operator opting in"). ALSO gated on `ledger.journal_on(

    writes to is gated on exactly that switch (see `ledger.append`'s own docstring, #2574/S1-G3),
    so without it the write would be silently dropped anyway; no point paying for the API call and
    subprocess spawn first only to discard the result. IT CALLS THE SWITCH, it does not re-derive
    it: this is the one place that duplicated the old, pre-rename config read, and a
    managed-settings lock that turns the journal ON must not leave this pre-gate closed, or the
    `model_choice` emit below would be skipped on exactly the installs org policy just enabled.
    The cost of the switch here is one `stat` (~19 µs, this machine) per pick, three orders below
    the `gh` call it is protecting. Then on
    non-empty fetched text -- a degraded/malformed `fetch_title_body` read (e.g. a `GitHubSource`
    payload that didn't parse) must never classify nothing into a confident-looking, entirely
    fabricated `sonnet` entry, matching the north-star's own "never a fabricated reading" non-goal.
    Measured cost when both gates are open: ~28ms median for the `why` subprocess alone (this
    machine) -- a per-goal-pick cost, not a hot-loop one.

    Reads the goal's REAL text through `source.fetch_title_body` -- the same source-agnostic,
    already-tested seam `decompose_check` and `review_context.py` both use -- rather than passing
    the bare identifier as text. In github mode `goal` is just an issue number ("1627"), which
    `predict.py`'s own `_read()` returns UNCHANGED (it only resolves local file paths), so a
    goal-identifier-as-text call would always land the unsignalled `sonnet` default; classifying
    the actual title+body instead is what fixes that second, compounding bug.

    PRINTS THE RESOLVED TIER TO STDERR ON SUCCESS, not only on failure (a code-review finding on an
    earlier draft): SKILL.md still tells an agent to separately run `predict.py resolve "$goal"
    .sdlc` by hand to learn the tier for dispatching phase subagents, and in github mode that
    manual re-run shares the exact same bug this function exists to fix -- `$goal` there is the
    bare issue number, not real text, so a manual recomputation lands the wrong, unsignalled
    default even after THIS call has already recorded the correct one. Printing the tier this
    function already computed is what lets an agent read the right answer instead of recomputing a
    wrong one; see the SKILL.md paragraph this function is cited from for the corrected guidance."""

    issues under `feature:<unit>`" can newly become true. `work.finish()` was the alternative and is
    wrong -- it refuses outright on the documented `auto_merge: off` / fork / read-only paths, so on

    IT DECIDES NOTHING, WHICH IS THE POINT OF THE WHOLE FEATURE. The return value is ignored here

    exists for the CLI verb and for tests. See `unit_completion`'s own docstring for why the merge
    that would land a unit deliberately still has no owner.

    NOT ON A HOT PATH, and that is what makes calling `work.sibling_gate` from inside it affordable

    goal is over, its outcome is already recorded, and the loop's next pick is a separate call. The
    wait is bounded to at most once per unit ever, because the sibling is only consulted after the
    board says zero open issues.

    own marker is unconditional as of #1197 (see `agent_start`) — this helper invents no new state
    of its own, it just asks the one question a reclaim decision for THIS SPECIFIC `goal` actually
    needs answered.

    `exclude_pids` (#2394) is who is ASKING, not evidence about the goal — the same `{os.getpid(),
    os.getppid(), session_pid}` set `work.py`'s `_calling_session_pids` already builds for the

    every ordinary resume/pick found its own registration and read it as foreign (#2394:
    `work.py start` refusing to resume the worktree it had itself just cut).
    Omitted (every pre-#2394 call site, and any caller with no identity to offer), this degrades to
    exactly the old behaviour — purely additive, byte-identical default; it only NARROWS what counts
    as foreign, never widens it.

    The two callers that need exactly this, both via `ledger.claim_belongs_to_me`'s
    `live_worker_check`: this module's own `_next()` (a picker deciding whether a
    dead-picker-pid claim is safe to reclaim) and `work.py`'s `_resume_blocked_by_a_live_sibling`
    (deciding whether to resume into an existing local worktree) — the same "is THIS goal's worker
    genuinely still alive?" question either way, so one implementation, not two. `_auto_reclaim_
    stale_claims`'s own sweep call site deliberately passes none: that pass is a genuinely different

    CORRECTION (post-#1237-review): this OR'd, goal-agnostic combination is right for
    `claim_lock_alive` below (its own, older, #494 consumer — "is `.sdlc` under active management
    at all" is exactly the question that call site needs) but was WRONG for the #1197 dead-picker
    reclaim-refusal check that briefly reused it here too. Reviewer-reproduced failure mode: with a
    long-lived managing session registered (`session_start`, the project's own documented
    overnight/routine shape), a DIFFERENT goal that has crashed and never even registered its own
    `agent_alive` marker was judged "still has a live worker" purely because `session_active` was
    True — permanently blocking that goal's reclaim for as long as the unrelated session ran
    anything at all, violating #1197's own acceptance criterion 4 ("a crash must not leave a goal
    permanently unpickable"). `_next()` and `_resume_blocked_by_a_live_sibling` now pass
    `_goal_has_registered_worker` — never this function — as `live_worker_check`, so a reclaim

    merged before this correction existed and briefly lagged behind it — see that function's own
    "#1284 FIX" docstring paragraph). This function itself is UNCHANGED and still correct for

    Revised post-#494 review: this used to apply the SAME two-signal combination
    `session_active`/`agent_alive` use on THEIR OWN markers — `ledger.pid_alive()` on the
    recorded pid, or the file's mtime past `ledger.lease_ttl_seconds(config)` as a fallback — to
    the claim lock's own stamped pid. That was wrong, not just imprecise: unlike THOSE two
    markers, whose recorded pid IS the long-lived thing being asked about, the claim lock's
    stamped pid (`_write_claim_lock_liveness`) is always the short-lived `next`/`next-batch` CLI
    invocation that won the acquisition — which exits within moments of returning, by design,
    regardless of whether a subagent goes on to work the goal for hours (see `session_start`'s
    own docstring, and SKILL.md's dispatch flow). So `ledger.pid_alive()` on THAT pid answers a
    question nobody asked: it reads "dead" within a fraction of a second of EVERY acquisition,
    whether the goal is genuinely abandoned or being actively, successfully worked — empirically
    confirmed with a real subprocess winning the lock and exiting normally, checked from a
    separate process a moment later. The 13 tests that shipped with #494 never caught this
    because every one of them checked liveness from the SAME still-running process that won the
    lock — a case that cannot occur in production, where `next`/`next-batch` is always a fresh,
    short-lived subprocess per call.

    Fixed by cross-checking `_claimed_goal_has_live_worker` FIRST — the two markers that DO
    correctly track a genuine long-lived pid for this exact question — before ever consulting the
    claim lock's own stamp. Only once neither shows activity does this fall back to the lock
    file's OWN mtime against the TTL (the same age-based backstop `session_active`/`agent_alive`
    already apply to their own markers) as a coarse "nobody has touched this in a very long time"
    signal — never to the stamped pid's liveness, which the paragraph above already disqualifies.
    A lock past the TTL with no corroborating trace either way is "dead"; the same lock still
    within the TTL, with no corroborating trace either way, is "unknown" — not enough evidence to
    call it either way yet, matching `reclaim_stale_claim_lock`'s own bias toward never deleting
    on a guess.

    "unknown" — no lock file at all (nothing has ever claimed `goal` locally, or a `_LOCK_UNAVAILABLE`
    fail-open path never wrote one), or one that PARSES as nothing (a pre-#494 lock, forever 0 bytes
    under the code that used to ship) — is deliberately NOT "dead": nobody recorded a pid here in any
    interpretable way, which is a strictly weaker claim than "recorded, and confirmed gone." An
    unsafe `goal` (see `_claim_lock_path`) degrades to "unknown" too, via the same except clause —

    """#1198: the crash-safety half of the `in_progress_label` fix. `_fetch_pending` (sources.py)
    now excludes ANY GitHub issue carrying `in_progress_label` unconditionally — closing the gap
    where `mark_in_progress` wrote that label on every pick, durably and visibly to every session,
    and the picker never read it back (an issue the loop had itself just claimed could be
    re-offered as the very next pick, including as the TOP pick). Excluding it unconditionally,
    on its own, would trade that bug for a worse one: a run that crashes mid-goal (claimed, label
    written, never reaches `record`/`release`) would leave the label in place FOREVER, making that
    goal permanently unpickable rather than merely temporarily stuck. This closes THAT gap: it
    reconciles the label against the ledger's own claim-lease TTL, the one place a "crashed" claim
    and a "still being worked" claim are already told apart.

    Gated on the EXISTING `ledger.enabled` switch (default off) — no new config key. With no
    ledger there is no durable claim TIMESTAMP to age a label against, so nothing here can tell
    "crashed" from "still being worked"; an adopter who never turns the ledger on pays literally
    nothing here, byte-identical to before this function existed.

    GitHub-only, and checked on the ACTUAL `source` object passed in — not reconstructed from
    config the way `_auto_unpark_sweep`'s own `sweep_unpark` does its own `sources.GitHubSource(
    config, ...)`. A `LocalSource` (or a test double) has no `in_progress_label` concept at all —
    `LocalSource.mark_in_progress` writes local `state.json`, single-machine, not the durable
    cross-session marker this reconciles against — so there is nothing here to reclaim for one.

    For every OPEN ledger claim aged past `ledger.lease_ttl_seconds(config)` (0/false = never
    expire — `ledger.expired_claims` already returns `{}` then, so this is a no-op): releases it
    through the SAME sanctioned path a human/CLI `release` verb uses (`_release()` — GitHub label
    stripped, board card back in Ready, one audit-trail comment, a `release` ledger entry
    recorded), naming the lease TTL as why. `_release()` mirrors `mark_in_progress`'s own
    best-effort `gh` calls, so a transient GitHub error here can never raise into this sweep.

    FAIL-OPEN, mirroring `_auto_unpark_sweep` exactly: ANY exception (an unreadable ledger, a bad
    config shape, anything `_release()` itself didn't already swallow) is caught here with one
    stderr line — a background reconciliation sweep must never be what stops an unattended pick.

    Returns a `frozenset` of the goal refs THIS call actually released. `_next()` folds this into
    its own pick-loop `skip` set — the SAME cooldown `_auto_unpark_sweep`'s docstring already
    explains: the goal a call just reclaimed must not ALSO be the one that SAME call's own pick
    returns, so a human gets one full `_next()` call's worth of a window on the audit comment
    before autonomous work can start on it. Free again from the very next `_next()` call.

    PR #1235 REVIEW FIX (Finding 1/3): `_release()` below is now told WHO the ledger itself
    recorded as the original claimant (`claim_actor`, threaded straight from `expired_claims()`'s
    own `(actor, writer, ts)` tuple — never re-derived, never guessed) so the `release` entry it
    writes can durably end THAT actor's lease even though the release is self-attributed (audit-
    honestly) to whichever actor is running THIS sweep. Without this, a cross-actor reclaim — the
    norm for any real multi-person ledger, and reachable solo whenever `ledger.actor` drifts
    between runs — never actually cleared `ledger.open_claims()`'s view: the SAME 'expired' claim
    was re-discovered and re-released, posting a duplicate GitHub audit comment, on every
    subsequent call, forever. See `ledger._held()`'s own docstring for the mechanism, and
    `test_auto_reclaim_durably_clears_a_different_actors_stale_claim`/
    `test_auto_reclaim_does_not_repost_a_duplicate_comment_on_a_second_sweep`
    (tests/test_loop.py) for the exact repro proven fixed.

    PR #1235 REVIEW FIX (round 2 — liveness corroboration): elapsed lease time alone is NOT
    sufficient evidence a claim was abandoned. The TTL only measures how long ago the last
    claim-refreshing ledger write landed, not whether the goal is still genuinely being worked —
    a long-running worker that writes no further ledger entries between `claimed` and its own
    eventual `record` (the common shape: exactly one append at each end, none in between) sails
    straight past the TTL while still actively in flight. An unconditional TTL-only sweep would
    therefore reclaim it out from under itself: label stripped, board card back in Ready, goal
    handed to a SECOND `_next()` call while the first is still working it. That is exactly the
    double-work collision #1197 documents for the picker's own claim check (a since-exited
    picker-process pid mistaken for the worker's own liveness) — this sweep had the identical hole
    on its release side, just reached via wall-clock age instead of a dead-pid misread. Fixed by
    requiring BOTH the lease to have expired AND `_goal_has_registered_worker` (loop.py:250 — the
    PER-GOAL `agent_alive` corroboration `_next()` and `work.py`'s
    `_resume_blocked_by_a_live_sibling` also use for the identical "is anyone still genuinely
    driving THIS goal?" question; see the #1284 FIX paragraph below for why this call site uses
    the per-goal check and not the OR'd `_claimed_goal_has_live_worker` `claim_lock_alive` above
    trusts) to report no live worker before a claim is reclaimed. A goal with a live worker is
    left untouched even past the TTL — it becomes eligible again on a later sweep once the worker
    marker itself goes stale, exactly like every other caller of this helper already degrades;
    nothing here invents a new state. This marker is opt-in and fails open to "no marker" when
    `agent_watch.enabled` is unset (see `_goal_has_registered_worker`'s own docstring), so an
    adopter who never turns it on sees byte-identical behavior to before this fix — this only
    NARROWS what gets reclaimed, never widens it. See
    `test_auto_reclaim_does_not_reclaim_a_stale_lease_with_a_live_worker_present`/
    `test_auto_reclaim_still_reclaims_a_stale_lease_with_no_live_worker` (tests/test_loop.py).

    PR #1269 REVIEW FIX (blocking finding 1): the liveness check just above closes the window
    against a genuine long-running WORKER, but not against the SAME actor's own SECOND, concurrent
    PROCESS legitimately re-claiming this exact goal, under a NEW `run_id`, in the real window
    between the `expired`/`expired_runs` snapshot below and this loop's own `_release()` call — the
    `_goal_has_registered_worker` check itself does one or more `gh` calls, not instant. Without
    this fix, `_release()`'s `reclaimed_actor=claim_actor` alone could still wipe that live re-claim
    (same actor name, different process — actor-only scoping cannot tell them apart; see
    `ledger._held()`'s own docstring). Fixed by ALSO threading `claim_run` — the stale claim's own
    `run_id`, sourced from `ledger.expired_claim_run_ids()` at the SAME snapshot moment as
    `claim_actor`, never re-derived after the race window opens — through to `_release()`'s new
    `claim_run` parameter, so its `reclaimed_run` durably names the STALE run being ended, and
    `ledger._held()` can tell it apart from a live reclaim under a different run. See
    `test_auto_reclaim_does_not_wipe_the_same_actors_live_reclaim_mid_sweep` (tests/test_loop.py).

    #1284 FIX (closes the gap found during the #1199 rebase, formerly pinned by what is now
    `test_auto_reclaim_sweep_reclaims_past_an_unrelated_live_session`): this call site used to
    check `_claimed_goal_has_live_worker`, which ORs in the GOAL-AGNOSTIC `session_active` signal,
    so an unrelated live session blocked THIS sweep from reclaiming a DIFFERENT, genuinely crashed
    goal — the same class of bug #1197's third follow-up had already fixed for `_next()`'s own
    `claim_belongs_to_me` check and `work.py`'s `_resume_blocked_by_a_live_sibling`, just never
    applied here (#1198 merged before #1197's correction existed). This matters more since #1199:
    every ordinary `/agrim-loop` call now passes `--session-pid "$PPID"`, so a live, correctly-
    registered session is the NORMAL running state, and `_fetch_pending` (sources.py) unconditionally
    excludes any issue still carrying `in_progress_label` — this sweep is the ONLY thing that clears
    that label after a crash, so the gap made a crashed goal invisible to the picker for as long as
    the unrelated session ran anything at all. Fixed by switching to `_goal_has_registered_worker`
    (per-goal only) above, mirroring #1197's own correction. See

    """#1661: the LAST word on `--feature` exclusivity -- may this run claim `goal`, given that
    `unit` is what it actually resolves to? True when no scope is in force.

    THE GUARANTEE, in the settled wording shared with `docs/branching-model.md` §14 and
    `/agrim-goal` (`tests/test_docs.py` pins the three copies against each other, byte for byte):

        While a `--feature` run is active, no goal outside that unit may be picked.

    Three commitments come with it, and this function plus `sources._issue_in_feature` are where
    they are kept:

      1. EXCLUSIVE, NOT PREFERENTIAL. Not as a fallback, not when the unit is drained, not as a
         "nothing else to do" convenience. When the unit has nothing pickable left the run STOPS
         (`_next` returns `("DONE", None)`) and `_feature_drained_note` says which kind of empty
         that was -- there is no widening back out to the backlog anywhere in the pick path.
      2. MEMBERSHIP IS THE DECLARATION PAIR, NEVER THE LABEL ALONE. The label is attached at pick,
         so a member nobody has picked yet may carry none; `sources._issue_in_feature` therefore
         adjudicates §4's pair through `features.read` rather than filtering the query on the
         label. See that method for what it costs and the one place a label filter survives.
      3. AN EXCLUDED GOAL IS LEFT UNTOUCHED -- not relabelled, not commented on, not parked, not
         claimed. See the paragraph on `_scope_ok_at_pick` below.

    WHY A SECOND CHECK EXISTS AT ALL, given (2) already filters the pool. `sources` decides
    membership from the LIST payload; `_unit_at_pick` is the value every OTHER pick-time gate and
    every downstream step (base resolution #1467, the registry #1469, sibling propagation) actually
    acts on, and the two can differ -- `_unit_at_pick` re-reads over REST when the GraphQL read
    failed (#1567), and a body edited between the list read and the claim resolves differently.
    Refusing on the resolved unit means the run refuses on exactly the value the rest of the pick
    will use, and it holds for any future queue path that never passes through `_fetch_pending`.

    A `unit` OF None IS REFUSED TOO, and that is commitment 1 stated in code: a goal that declares
    nothing is not "unclaimed by any unit and therefore available", it is outside the one unit this
    run was told to work. That covers the `UNREADABLE` case for free -- a declaration we could not
    read is not evidence the goal belongs here.

    NOT A REFUSAL IN THE `_scope_ok_at_pick`/`_owner_ok_at_pick` SENSE, and it must run BEFORE
    both. Those two hold a goal for a human (`sdlc:needs-confirmation`, a comment, a ledger line)
    because the goal itself has a problem. This one is not about the goal at all -- it is this
    run's own narrowing, and the goal is perfectly fine for the run that IS scoped to its unit. So
    nothing is written to it: no label, no overlay, no comment, no claim. It is simply passed

    THE BUG THIS CLOSES. `_next()` claimed first and asked afterwards. The only reader of the
    dependency data was `precheck`, which runs AFTER `mark_in_progress`: the label is on, the claim
    lock is taken, the issue is out of everyone else's queue, and the best available outcome is a
    claim-then-park round trip that consumed a lane. Measured live on a real DAG-shaped backlog
    (three goals, two of them `**Blocked by:** #1594`): three of four picks claimed a goal whose
    blocker was still open, and EVERY pick after the first returned the same blocked goal, so the
    loop could not reach the one pickable issue behind it without a human `--skip` on every call.
    An unattended run does not degrade on a dependency graph -- it stalls.

    A HOLD IS NOT A PARK, and that ordering is the whole fix. The goal is left exactly as it was
    found -- `sdlc:goal` intact, no `sdlc:in-progress`, no lock, no comment, no ledger line -- and
    the pick moves to the next candidate. It becomes pickable by itself the moment its blocker
    closes; nothing has to unpark it. This is why the check sits at the TOP of `_next()`'s candidate
    loop, ahead of the lease read and the claim lock, rather than anywhere after them.

    WHAT IT COSTS PER PICK: one local read of `board-mirror.ndjson`, memoized in `cache` for the
    whole `_next()` call AND RE-POPULATED BY AT MOST ONE FORCED REFETCH (the absence hole below, or
    #1650's hold refresh -- never both, and the two paragraphs after this one price them), plus
    `mirror.fetch_and_write`, which is TTL-guarded and therefore a stat and a return on a fresh
    mirror. ZERO `gh` calls whenever nothing is held — which is every pick
    on a backlog with no open dependency edge, i.e. the overwhelming common case. That bound is not
    a nicety: a single pick already burns ~35-45 GraphQL calls against a 5,000/hr bucket shared by
    every session on the account, so a gate that read one issue per candidate would compete with the
    disease it cures. Nothing here is per-candidate except a dict lookup. (The TTL refetch itself is
    two `gh issue list` calls per TTL window, and it is the SAME call `precheck` already makes, so
    on a `backlog_check.enabled` repo the gate adds nothing at all; on a repo without it, it is two
    calls an hour, which is what makes the gate work on a stock config rather than only where the
    cross-check happens to be switched on.)

    A HOLD, AND ONLY A HOLD, BUYS A REFRESH (#1650) — two more `gh issue list` calls, at most ONCE
    per `_next()` call however many candidates are held, and never when this call already fetched
    live. The measured defect: `ttl_minutes` ships at 60, so a blocker an operator had just closed
    by hand went on holding its dependents for up to an hour while the loop reported `DONE, nothing
    pickable` — indistinguishable from a stall, and misdiagnosed as one by an earlier trial. The
    branch is deliberately here rather than beside the absence check above: staleness only changes
    the OUTCOME when the answer is a hold, so paying for it anywhere earlier would buy the call on
    picks the mirror was already right about. Not bounded per PROCESS the way `_MIRROR_FORCED` is,
    and that asymmetry is the point — a goal absent from the mirror is absent for a reason a second
    fetch cannot fix, whereas a blocker's state is exactly the thing that changes underneath a
    long-lived `run_loop`, so the bound has to reset every call. Worst case is 2 calls per call that
    holds; best and common case is unchanged at zero (`test_a_goal_whose_declared_prerequisites_
    are_all_closed_pays_nothing`).

    THE REFRESH IS MERGED OVER THE MIRROR, NEVER SUBSTITUTED FOR IT. A refreshed corpus that no
    longer carries a blocker (its goal label removed, past `mirror._OPEN_LIMIT`, an assignee filter)
    holds LESS evidence than the mirror already did, and the last thing observed about that blocker
    was that it was OPEN. Replacing the index would demote it to `unknown`, which fails open — the
    right posture for a ref nobody has ever seen, and the wrong one for a ref seen open a minute
    ago. So the fresh records win where they exist and the old ones survive where they do not; a
    refresh can release a hold but can never lose the evidence behind one. And when the refresh
    cannot be made at all (no `gh`, offline, a `gh` error object), the hold STILL STANDS and the age
    of the evidence behind it is printed — #1650's own weaker remedy, kept as the fallback for
    exactly the case where the stronger one cannot run.

    THE `goal_not_in_corpus` HOLE, and why a TTL alone is not enough. A mirror that is fresh by TTL
    but was written BEFORE the issues now being picked existed answers "I have no dependency data
    for this goal" in exactly the same shape as "I checked, there is none". With the default
    60-minute TTL that is a coin flip immediately after a batch of issues is filed -- which is
    precisely when a dependency chain is newest and most load-bearing. So a goal ABSENT from the
    mirror forces one refresh rather than proceeding on no evidence, bounded by `_MIRROR_FORCED` to
    once per process, and skipped entirely when this same call already fetched live.

    FAIL OPEN, AND SAY SO. Three states cannot be determined, and all three CLAIM: no mirror at all,
    a goal still absent after the forced refresh, and a prerequisite the mirror does not carry (its
    open half is `sdlc:goal`-filtered and its closed half is windowed, so an open non-goal issue or
    an old close resolves to nothing). Claiming is the recoverable direction -- a wrongly-held goal
    stalls the loop, which is the bug being fixed -- but an undeterminable state is never silent:
    each prints what it could not resolve. The outer `except` has the same posture as
    `_auto_unpark_sweep`'s: a gate that breaks must never be the thing that stops an unattended pick.

    ONE VOCABULARY. The refs come off the mirror record via `blocker_scan.read_refs` -- the field
    `blocker_scan.extract_refs` wrote at fetch time, read back by the module that wrote it. No regex
    runs here and no second parser exists; `test_the_pick_gate_declares_no_blocker_vocabulary_of_
    its_own` pins that at the source level. Note this is the EXPLICIT subset (`blocked by` /
    `depends on` / `depends upon`) rather than the wider check-time set: declining to claim is an
    autonomous act, and that subset is the one measured on a real board at whole-body width (21 of
    21 genuine edges, no phantom -- see `blocker_scan.TRIGGERS`). A weak trigger inside the excerpt
    is still found by `precheck`, where a human sees a comment and can dismiss it."""

#: (verb, sdlc_dir, goal, ...). `note` already takes a goal-scoped side effect keyed on exactly
#: `argv[2], argv[3]` (its own `agent_heartbeat_all` call), so this is an established shape here,
#: not a new one.
#:
#: `record` is deliberately NOT here, and that exclusion is the whole design. It is evidence work
#: has ENDED, so arming there would write claimed_ts ~= terminal_ts -- a synthesized span, which is
#: precisely what #1962 forbids ("Never synthesize a timestamp to make a number look better"). A
#: goal whose only loop.py call is `record` stays honestly unclaimed, and the downstream
#: claimed-coverage gap report is what makes that residue visible instead of silent.
#:
#: `qc` was in this tuple too and is out for BOTH reasons at once, caught by the full suite rather
#: than by inspection (`test_cli_qc_verb_is_a_safe_noop_for_local`). It is a Review-phase verb, so
#: arming there lands claimed_ts almost on terminal_ts -- the same drift toward a synthesized span
#: that `record` is excluded for -- and it is contractually BOARD-ONLY, so claiming through it made
#: `mark_in_progress` rewrite a local goal file that the verb promises never to touch. `note`
#: already covers every /agrim-goal phase from P1 onward, so nothing is lost by dropping it.
#:
#: `emit`, `log`, `precheck` and `decompose-check` were in this tuple in the first draft and were
#: removed at plan-review. They are EVALUATIVE, not committal: predict.py's `_emit_model_choice`
#: shells out to `loop.py emit <goal> model_choice` from an ADVISORY /agrim-model question that can
#: be asked about ANY goal, and `precheck`/`decompose-check` describe themselves below as an
#: "opt-in pre-work backlog cross-check" and an "opt-in oversized-goal classifier". Arming on those
#: reaches `mark_in_progress`, writing `sdlc:in-progress` on an issue nobody is working -- which
#: `_next()` then reads as claimed and SKIPS. Asking which tier a goal deserves would have silently
#: removed it from the backlog. Regression-covered both ways.

    """The claim, in ONE place (#1962). Extracted verbatim from `_next()` so that `next`, the
    `claim` verb and `_ensure_claimed` cannot drift into three subtly different claims.

    ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING and unchanged from `_next()`: `mark_in_progress` FIRST (the durable,
    cross-session signal every other session reads), then the ledger entry, then the actionlog,
    then the session registry.

    `why` is passed only by the self-arming path, so an armed claim stays distinguishable from a
    picked one in the ledger forever. It costs the pick path nothing: `append()` drops a None
    field, so a `next`-issued claim is written byte-for-byte as it was before this parameter
    existed (verified empirically, not assumed).

    `mark=False` (#2029) writes the LOCAL half only -- ledger, actionlog, session registry -- and
    skips `mark_in_progress`, the one step of a claim that reaches OUTSIDE this machine. Only
    `_ensure_claimed` ever passes it, and only for a target that is not a member of the backlog;
    see `_arming_may_mark`. The pick path (`_next`, the `claim` verb) never passes it and is
    byte-for-byte unchanged, because there membership is already proven -- `_fetch_pending` asks
    the server for `--label sdlc:goal` -- so marking IS picking.

    #2392: `mark_in_progress` now reports back whether its own claim-label write actually landed
    (`True`), or genuinely exhausted its retries and failed (`False` -- `GitHubSource` only;
    `LocalSource.mark_in_progress` returns `None`, which the `is False` check below deliberately
    does not match, since a local goal has no external label to fail). `mark_in_progress` already
    escalates loudly to stderr on that failure (`_escalate_claim_label_failure`) -- this folds the
    SAME fact into the `claimed` entry's own `why` too, so it is not lost once that stderr line
    scrolls away. Reuses the EXISTING `why` OPTIONAL_FIELD rather than adding a new ledger field:
    `why` is already free text, already rendered wherever a claimed entry is read, and every
    non-`None` `_swap_labels_best_effort` call site elsewhere in this codebase already writes to
    stderr, never to a dedicated ledger field, for the identical class of failure. Appended after
    any self-arming `why`, not replacing it, so an armed claim whose label write also failed keeps

    number it was handed, and `_claim`'s first act writes `sdlc:in-progress` to a real issue.
    `agrim-goal-review` closes on two `loop.py note` calls that deliberately target tickets which
    are NEVER goals: the Dossier (`story`) in SKILL.md §4d and the Spec/Epic in §5g. On
    2026-09-01 that labelled story #2017 and epic #2020 in progress, 2 seconds before each
    comment landed -- reproduced deterministically, not inferred.

    Three things were wrong at once, and the membership question fixes all three:
      * `docs/label-model.md` §4a's ORPHAN class -- `{sdlc:in-progress}` with no membership label
        -- was being MANUFACTURED by the tool whose `doctor.py:_orphan_in_progress_scan` exists to
        report it.
      * `loop.py`'s own contract for this very verb ("for `agrim-goal-review`'s REJECT verdict,
        this note is THE ENTIRE OUTPUT: no label, no board move, nothing else"), repeated in
        `skills/agrim-goal-review/SKILL.md` and in `AGENTS.md`, was false: a REJECT wrote a label.
      * on a real but UNPICKED goal it is a silent backlog deletion bounded by the lease --
        `_fetch_pending` excludes any issue carrying `in_progress_label` unconditionally, so a
        `note` from `/agrim-plan-review` or `/agrim-retro` removed a pending goal from the queue
        until `_auto_reclaim_stale_claims` reclaimed it 12h later.

    THE POSTURE IS DELIBERATELY ASYMMETRIC: fail OPEN on the local record, fail CLOSED on the
    external write. A claim we could not justify is still worth recording locally (that is the
    whole point of #1962 -- `claimed_ts` for goals the picker never chose), but a label we could
    not justify is a write onto somebody else's issue. So an unreadable answer skips the mark and
    says so on stderr; it never blocks the verb, and it never blocks the ledger entry.

    A SOURCE WITH NO UNIT SURFACE KEEPS TODAY'S BEHAVIOUR EXACTLY. `LocalSource` has no
    `fetch_body_labels` -- the same `hasattr` gate `feature_stamp.unit_of` uses for the same reason
    -- and in local mode a goal resolves to a file under `.sdlc/goals/`, so membership is inherent
    in the argument and there is no external surface to protect. Returning True there is not a
    concession; it is the correct answer.

    COST: one `gh issue view --json body,labels` per goal per machine, and no more, because the
    only caller reaches it behind `_ensure_claimed`'s O(1) marker on the miss path -- the same
    place the O(ledger) read already sits. `test_arming_reads_the_whole_ledger_at_most_once_per_goal`

    WHY THIS EXISTS IN PYTHON RATHER THAN IN A SKILL.md LINE. `/agrim-goal` names its own goal
    instead of asking the picker for one, so nothing on that path emitted `claimed` at all. A
    SKILL.md instruction is prose an agent may forget, and this repo has already corrected exactly
    that failure mode once -- see `_predict_model_choice_at_pick`, moved into the code because a
    real `model_choice` event was "depending on a calling skill's SKILL.md remembering a second
    instruction". Cursor has no hooks either, so the trigger has to live here.

    TWO-STAGE CHECK, and the order is a measured cost decision. `ledger.read_all` is O(the whole
    ledger): measured 31 ms mean / 224 ms cold over 1,591 entries across 1,193 files on this repo,
    and the ledger only ever grows -- ~310 ms at 10x and ~3.1 s at 100x, which `note` would then
    pay on EVERY phase of EVERY goal. So a per-goal marker file is asked first (one stat, O(1)),
    and the full ledger read is reached only on a miss: at most once per goal per machine, never
    in steady state. `test_arming_reads_the_whole_ledger_at_most_once_per_goal` asserts that
    bound rather than trusting this paragraph.

    THE LEDGER STAGE IS NOT OPTIONAL, and the marker is deliberately not the only check: the
    marker is local and the actionlog is local-only and never shipped, so a goal claimed by a
    teammate's loop on ANOTHER machine has a ledger claim and nothing local at all. The cheap
    check alone would write it a second claim.

    THE TIMESTAMP IS AN OBSERVATION, NOT A FABRICATION. It is the first moment Sigma observed
    work on this goal, which is later than the true pick-up by however long the agent took to
    reach its first goal-scoped verb. `why` records which kind of claim it is, so the two are
    never conflated downstream.

    THE LEDGER OPT-IN IS NOT THE ONLY GUARD, and treating it as one was #2029. It answers "may
    Sigma record anything here?", never "is this ticket a goal?" -- so on an opted-in repo the
    claim's external half landed on whatever number the verb was handed, including the Dossier and
    the Epic that `agrim-goal-review` closes on by design. `_arming_may_mark` asks the membership
    question, and only the EXTERNAL half is gated on the answer: the ledger entry, the actionlog

    proper unit recorded BOTH on its issue (the `feature:<name>` label, or a bare body marker) AND
    in that unit's own registry entry, and repair the registry side when the two have drifted apart.

    MODELLED DIRECTLY ON `_ensure_watcher`/`_ensure_ledger_delivery`, PER THE EXPLICIT REQUEST THAT
    MOTIVATED IT: config-gated, fail-open, called from the same class of trigger those two are
    ("a loop trigger keeps X alive on its own"), and never once load-bearing to the pick or the
    goal it rides alongside. It NEVER blocks, NEVER raises into the verb that triggered it, and its
    only visible effect on failure is a warning: one stderr line (`feature_labels._note`, via
    `ensure_unit_tracking`) and, at most once per issue, one comment on it
    (`feature_labels._flag`) -- exactly "flag a warning... nothing breaking the main purpose... just
    a side job", never a second, competing answer to what `feature_sync.sync_at_pick` (`work.start`)
    already owns authoritatively at pick time. See `feature_labels.ensure_unit_tracking`'s own
    docstring for the full design and for why this is not the "second sync path" that module's own
    `main()` explicitly forbids.

    THE COOLDOWN IS THE COST CONTROL, and its reason is `_ensure_ledger_delivery`'s reason restated
    for a REST read instead of a ledger read: a goal-scoped verb fires many times across one goal's
    life (once per SDLC phase, typically), and re-reading the issue on every single one would be
    real, avoidable network cost for a check whose answer changes rarely. The marker is touched
    BEFORE the attempt (mirroring `_ensure_ledger_delivery`'s own ordering) so a check that itself
    raises cannot spin the next trigger into retrying the same expensive read immediately.

    `cooldown_s` defaults to the same 300s `_ensure_ledger_delivery` uses, for the same reason: no
    measurement argues for a different number, and matching an existing default is one fewer knob
    for an operator to have to understand is unrelated to the other one."""

    """(kind, goal_or_reason): 'goal' (+marks in_progress, the commit point — second element is
    the goal ref), 'DONE' (drained — second element None on a genuine empty read, or, #1084, a
    short degraded-read reason string when `source.read_degraded()` is True — mirrors BUDGET's own
    shape), 'BUDGET' (second element a short diagnostic naming which ceiling tripped and the
    observed-vs-configured numbers, #411 — see `_budget_reason`; never None once budget genuinely
    trips), 'HANDOFF' (#2521, same shape as BUDGET's own diagnostic, from `_handoff_reason` — a
    deliberate, healthy context-bound stop). Precedence, most-checked-first: a REAL resource BUDGET
    stop (max_minutes/max_tokens, #2515) beats HANDOFF beats the remaining (max_iterations-only)
    BUDGET case — see the three-part gate's own comments just above its call site for why a resource
    ceiling cannot be allowed to lose that tie the way the iterations one deliberately does.
    Drained backlog reports DONE even
    if budget is also spent (empty wins the tie). A goal another actor — or a DIFFERENT, still-live
    process of MY OWN actor — already holds a ledger claim on is skipped (see
    `_lease`/`ledger.claim_belongs_to_me`, F10.5/#374) so two loops never double-start it, whether
    they're two different people or two of one person's own concurrent sessions. #1197: "still-live
    process" is no longer judged on the claim's WRITER pid alone — that pid is always the
    short-lived picker invocation that wrote the claim, dead within moments regardless of whether
    the goal itself is still being worked — a dead writer pid is now corroborated against
    `_goal_has_registered_worker` (passed as `claim_belongs_to_me`'s `live_worker_check`) before
    being treated as abandoned, so a second session picking minutes after the first's `next`
    invocation already exited can no longer re-pick a goal a long-running subagent still holds.
    Deliberately the PER-GOAL check, not the OR'd `_claimed_goal_has_live_worker` — see that
    function's own docstring for why a goal-agnostic "is anyone managing `.sdlc` at all" signal
    must never gate a specific goal's reclaim. A goal genuinely
    uncommitted-to-either-way that a SIBLING process on this machine wins the exact-instant race
    for is ALSO skipped (see `_try_acquire_claim_lock`, F10.5-2/#387) — #374 alone can only
    arbitrate a claim that already exists; this closes the narrower, true-simultaneous case #374
    structurally cannot. `extra_skip` (F4) is run_loop's own poison set — a goal neither the primary
    nor the fallback park-record could be recorded for, this run — so a doubly-failing source doesn't
    spin forever.

    #1199: ALSO skips every goal any OTHER live session has registered as in-flight (see
    `_session_in_flight_goals`) — the gap `test_next_without_skip_would_redispatch_a_goal_still_
    marked_in_progress` (tests/test_loop.py) proves is otherwise real: a source-level `in_progress`
    status alone does not stop a later `_next()` from re-serving the SAME goal, ledger or no ledger.
    Composed automatically, with NO `--skip` from the caller, GIVEN a correct `session_pid` —
    `session_pid` identifies THIS call's own session. #1239 review (finding 1): the default here
    (`os.getppid()`, resolved below when `session_pid` is `None`) is THIS `loop.py` process's OWN
    immediate parent — for a genuinely continuous caller (one live Python process across many
    `_next()` calls, e.g. `run_loop`, or a plain interactive shell that never forks an intermediate
    subprocess per command) that IS the caller's own stable identity. It is NOT, in general, stable
    across SEPARATE CLI invocations issued one-per-tool-call by a tool-calling agent: confirmed
    directly (two independent `python3 -c "import os; print(os.getppid())"` runs, each dispatched
    the way a single Bash-tool call actually wraps its payload — a shell that must genuinely fork
    because it also runs something else afterward, not tail-exec away — return DIFFERENT values,
    because each such invocation's immediate parent is a fresh, per-call shell wrapper, not any
    long-lived ancestor above it). The shipped `/agrim-loop` skill is exactly that shape, so it does
    NOT rely on this fallback: it captures its OWN invoking shell's `$PPID` (one level further up
    than any single `os.getppid()` call from inside a spawned process can see — the shell's own
    parent, which testably IS the same stable process across separate tool-style calls) and passes
    it explicitly via `--session-pid` on every `start`/`next`/`next-batch` call (see SKILL.md). This
    function's own `os.getppid()` default remains only as a last-resort value for a caller that
    supplies nothing at all — better than no identity, not a substitute for an explicitly threaded
    one. A goal this call goes on to claim below is registered as in-flight under `session_pid` —
    auto-registering it if `start --session-pid`/the CLI `start` verb never explicitly did — so the
    NEXT live session's own `_next()` call (a different `session_pid`) skips it without being told,
    PROVIDED both calls were given the same, genuinely stable, `session_pid`.

    #1129: also runs the opt-in auto-unpark sweep FIRST, before this call's own pick — the real
    production chokepoint every driver (the CLI `next` verb, `next_batch`, `run_loop`) already
    passes through, so wiring it once here covers all three, the same reasoning
    `_emit_run_stop_once`'s own docstring gives for sitting at this exact spot.

    #1129-followup cooldown: the sweep CAN flip a goal `sdlc:parked` -> `sdlc:goal` and post its
    audit comment in this same call — but the goal(s) it just flipped (`just_unparked`, from
    `_auto_unpark_sweep`'s return) are folded into this call's own `skip` set, so
    `source.next_pending()` right below can never ALSO return one of them in the SAME call. That
    gives a human one full `_next()` call's worth of a real window to read the audit comment and
    re-park it, if it was a deliberate checkpoint, before autonomous work can start on it — the
    sweep itself still can't tell a deliberate park from a stale one (see `auto_unpark.py`'s
    docstring), so this cooldown is the mitigation, not detection. `just_unparked` is a plain local
    — nothing persists it — so the goal is fully eligible again starting the very next `_next()`
    call, whether that's the next `run_loop` iteration, the next `next_batch` slot, or a wholly
    separate future invocation.

    #1198: also runs the opt-in (existing `ledger.enabled` switch, no new config) auto-reclaim
    sweep, `_auto_reclaim_stale_claims` — SAME cooldown, folded into this call's own `skip` set as
    `just_reclaimed` — releasing any GitHub claim aged past the ledger lease TTL so a crashed run's
    goal does not stay permanently unpickable now that `_fetch_pending` excludes `in_progress_label`
    unconditionally. Run BEFORE `_lease()` reads the ledger below, so a claim this same call just
    released is already reflected in that fresh read, not one call stale.

    #1468: the winning goal's declared unit label is attached between winning the claim LOCK and
    `mark_in_progress` — the last point at which nothing has yet acted on the goal, and every later
    step (base resolution, the registry, sibling propagation) reads that label. A goal whose label
    cannot be attached is REFUSED rather than parked: it keeps `sdlc:goal`, gains the
    `sdlc:needs-label` overlay and one comment on its own timeline, joins this call's `skip` set,
    and the pick moves to the next candidate — so an issue waiting on a human never stalls the queue
    behind it, is never reported as ready to pick, and needs no unpark once the human acts.
    `_feature_needs_label_sweep` (budget-gated, above) clears the overlay again. See
    `feature_labels.attach_at_pick` for the split (attach automatically, never create).

    #1499: and BEFORE any of that -- before the lease read, before the claim lock, before the label
    -- a candidate whose own body declares a prerequisite that is still OPEN is not claimed at all.
    It is not claimed and released, and not claimed and parked: it is left exactly as it was found,
    keeps `sdlc:goal`, joins this call's `skip` set, and the pick moves on, so it becomes pickable
    by itself the moment its blocker closes. This is the one ordering in this function that is
    load-bearing for a DAG-shaped backlog: with the check after the claim, every pick returned the
    same blocked goal and the loop could not reach the pickable issue behind it (measured live).
    See `_pick_dependency_hold` for what it reads, what it costs, and the three states it fails
    open on."""

        # issue of its own. A goal declaring a unit from a repo that unit does not list is refused
        # here rather than parked: it becomes `sdlc:needs-confirmation` (inert until its owner
        # promotes it -- a scope expansion needs a DECISION, unlike a missing label, which
        # self-heals), joins this call's `skip` set, and the pick moves on. Same lock discipline as
        # the line above it: the refusal path leaves the loop without reaching the `try/finally`
        # below, so the claim lock is released explicitly or the goal is unpickable by anyone.
        # #1479: and then WHO FILED IT. Same lock, same moment, same refusal shape as the scope
        # check above -- `sdlc:needs-confirmation`, inert until its owner promotes it -- but a
        # different question: that one asks whether the unit may touch this repo, this one asks
        # whether the person who opened the issue was entitled to put work on this board at all.
        # Short-circuited behind it deliberately: a goal already held for scope must not also be
        # held for ownership, or one pick would collect two comments and two ledger entries.

        # `feature/<unit>`. One un-retried `gh issue view` made the first answer None and left the

        # against that unit had been told there is no unit. Only on a FAILED read, and only on an
        # adopted project; see that function for what it costs and what it deliberately does not do.
        # #1661: `--feature`'s exclusivity is enforced HERE, on the resolved unit, and FIRST among

        # wrong with it: it must be passed over in silence, not flagged. On the resolved unit
        # because the scoped query filters on the LABEL, and on a self-contradicting issue the label

    (F10.5-3/#375) — repeatedly calls `_next()`, accumulating each pick on top of `extra_skip` so
    the SAME session's own multiple slots can never collide with each other, without even
    touching the ledger a second time per pick (the exact `extra_skip` hook #335/F4 already added;
    #387's local lock backs genuine CROSS-session races further, orthogonal to this).

    #1199: `session_pid` (default `os.getppid()`, resolved once per `_next()` call — see that
    function's own docstring) now closes the OTHER half of the gap the next two paragraphs
    describe, automatically: a slot freed and refilled AFTER this call already returned is covered
    because the earlier pick is still sitting in THIS session's own in-flight registry, which
    `_next()` reads on every call, from any process, not only within one `next_batch` call. Passing
    `--skip`/`extra_skip` explicitly still works exactly as before (tests rely on it, and it is the
    only lever for skipping a goal that was never actually claimed by any session), but a caller no
    longer NEEDS it just to avoid re-dispatching its own prior picks.

    `extra_skip` matters beyond this one call: #374's writer-liveness check can only ever answer
    "is the process that WROTE this claim still literally running" — and the process that writes a
    claim is a single short-lived `loop.py` invocation that has already exited by the time this
    function returns, regardless of whether the GOAL itself is still being actively worked by a
    long-running subagent. So a caller refilling a freed slot some time AFTER this call returned —
    not within it — must pass the OTHER, still-active goals from prior calls back in as
    `extra_skip` itself; nothing pid-based stands in for that once the picking call that wrote the
    claim is gone. `next()`'s CLI verb takes the same thing as `--skip a,b,c` for exactly this.

    #1197 narrows this, it does not remove it: `_next()` now also corroborates a dead writer pid
    against `_goal_has_registered_worker` before reclaiming, which is exactly what protects a
    LATER picker (a wholly separate `next`/`next-batch` invocation, possibly minutes on) once the
    dispatched subagent has reached SKILL.md step 3a and actually called `agent-start`. It cannot
    help THIS same-pass refill: the slot this call just filled has not been dispatched yet, so no
    marker for it exists at the moment a sibling slot's refill runs — `extra_skip` remains the only
    thing that closes that specific, immediate window, unchanged.

    `max_concurrent` defaults to `goals_parallel(config)`'s own setting when omitted — OFF (the
    default; a repo that hasn't opted in) degrades to a single-item batch, byte-identical to
    calling `_next()` once — so a caller can always call this the SAME way regardless of whether
    goal-level parallelism is configured on, rather than needing two separate code paths.

    Unlike `slices.py`'s `schedule()`/`conflicts()`, goals need NO file-level conflict detection:
    each goal gets its OWN worktree+branch+PR (`work.py start()`), so two goals touching
    overlapping files is, at worst, a routine PR-rebase later (the established CHANGELOG-cascade
    pattern this whole plugin's own history already handles routinely) — not the
    silently-lost-edit risk `conflicts()` exists to prevent for slices sharing ONE worktree.

    Returns a list of `(kind, goal)` tuples: zero or more `("goal", <goal>)` entries, followed by
    exactly one terminal `("DONE", <reason-or-None>)`, `("BUDGET", <reason>)`, or `("HANDOFF",
    <reason>)` (#2521) IFF the backlog/budget/hand-off ceiling ran out before filling every slot —
    DONE's second element is `None` on a genuine empty read and, #1084, a short degraded-read
    reason string when `source.read_degraded()` is True (mirrors BUDGET's own shape); BUDGET's
    `<reason>` names which ceiling tripped and the observed-vs-configured numbers (#411, see
    `_budget_reason`), never `None` for a genuine budget stop. A full batch of `max_concurrent`
    `"goal"` entries with no terminal entry means every slot filled, with the backlog possibly not
    yet exhausted.

    Each `_next()` atomically reserves its own session's next admission before returning a goal.
    The same check governs a later `next` refill, so both paths honor goal-count ceilings even
    while sibling slots remain active or another session resets the shared budget cursor."""

    driving `.sdlc` (F10.5-4/#377), so a routine firing again before this one finishes can tell NOT
    to launch a redundant one — the same class of risk F10.5/#374 already closes one level down (a
    routine blindly resuming ANOTHER session's in-flight worktree, not launching a whole second one).

    Writes THIS session's own registry entry (`_session_marker_path`) rather than the old shared
    file. Calling it again for the same identity preserves its `in_flight` goals. Claude's identity
    remains the PID; Codex desktop adds CODEX_THREAD_ID because distinct tasks share a shell parent.

    `session_pid` must be the CALLER's own long-lived process id — the routine/skill layer's, not
    any individual `loop.py` invocation's own. Confirmed empirically that this distinction is real,
    not theoretical: two separate shell-tool calls in the SAME host session get two DIFFERENT `$$`
    (a fresh subprocess each time — the same reason `next`'s `--skip` flag exists, see F10.5-3/#375),
    but the SAME `$PPID` (the long-lived parent the shell-tool calls share — confirmed directly by
    reading `$PPID` from the SHELL itself across separate calls, not by calling `os.getppid()` from
    inside a spawned `python3`; see the next paragraph for why those two are NOT the same value).
    Recording THIS call's own `os.getpid()` — a `python3 loop.py ...` process that exits within
    moments of returning — would make the marker read as immediately dead, useless for a session
    running minutes-to-hours across many separate `loop.py` calls. The routine/skill prompt captures
    `$PPID` (or an equivalent stable id) ONCE — really, once per call, since re-reading the SHELL's
    own `$PPID` keeps yielding that same stable value every time, no persistence needed — and passes
    it through every call that needs it, via `--session-pid`. On Codex desktop that PID proves
    liveness but does not uniquely identify a task; a validated CODEX_THREAD_ID supplies that half.

    #1239 review (finding 1/2): `_next()`/`next_batch()` ALSO default to `os.getppid()` internally
    when no explicit `session_pid` is given — but that is `os.getppid()` measured from INSIDE the
    `loop.py` PYTHON PROCESS itself, which is one level SHALLOWER than the shell's own `$PPID` this
    docstring just established as stable: it returns THIS process's immediate parent, the per-call
    shell wrapper a tool-calling agent's Bash-tool-style invocation forks fresh each time (confirmed:
    it differs across separate calls), not the long-lived grandparent above it. That Python-level
    default is a last-resort fallback for a caller that passes nothing at all (a genuinely continuous
    process like `run_loop`, or a plain manual shell where it happens to coincide) — it is NOT a
    substitute for the shell-level `$PPID` capture-and-pass-through this docstring describes, and the
    shipped `/agrim-loop` skill does NOT rely on it: SKILL.md passes `--session-pid "$PPID"`
    explicitly on `start`/`next`/`next-batch` (see `main`'s dispatch for all three).

    Best-effort, mirrors `agent_end`'s own unconditional-cleanup posture: attempted even for a goal
    with no in-flight registration anywhere (a stale claim already cleared, or one this session
    never itself claimed) — a safe no-op either way.

    #1239 review (finding 3): each session's own write is now scoped inside THAT session's own
    `_session_locked` (same guard `_session_claim`/`session_start` use for their entry) — this
    call touches potentially several sessions' files, one lock at a time, never all at once, so a
    release can never deadlock against a sibling `_session_claim`/`session_start` that holds a
    DIFFERENT session's lock. `in_flight` is re-read from disk inside the lock (the copy from
    `_session_entries` above may already be stale by the time the lock is acquired) so a claim that
    landed in the gap between the scan and the lock is never dropped by this release.

    The lock is now taken for EVERY entry `_session_entries` yields, not only ones whose STALE
    `in_flight` snapshot already shows `goal` — an earlier version of this fix filtered on that
    snapshot first (`if goal in in_flight: ...`) and reproduced a second, subtler race
    (`test_session_claim_and_release_race_do_not_lose_updates`): `Path.write_text` truncates its
    target to 0 bytes on open, before writing the new content, so this call's own UNLOCKED scan can
    land inside a CONCURRENT locked writer's truncate-then-write window, read invalid/empty JSON,
    and — via `_session_read`'s own by-design fail-open, `except (OSError, ValueError): return
    {"in_flight": []}` — see an empty list for a file that genuinely, durably contains the goal.
    The stale pre-check then skipped that session's lock entirely: no exception, no attempt, the
    goal silently never released. Locking unconditionally means the only read that can ever decide
    whether `goal` is removed is the one taken INSIDE that session's own lock, where no concurrent
    writer can be mid-truncate — correctness over the minor cost of locking a session that turns
    out not to hold `goal`."""

    agent STARTED. A goal worked for longer than the lease — this repo ships
    `budget.max_minutes: 900` against `lease.ttl_hours: 12`, so an ordinary overnight goal qualifies
    — read as DEAD while its agent was still actively working. Every consumer of
    `_goal_has_registered_worker` therefore lost its protection exactly when the goal was
    long-running, which is precisely when losing it hurts most.

    The TTL itself is still the right backstop: it guards PID REUSE (a different process inheriting
    a recorded pid). Heartbeating does not weaken that — a reused pid is not the thing refreshing
    THIS marker — it just stops the check firing on a healthy long-running agent.

# an exhausted GitHub REST/GraphQL rate limit) now gets its own REASON_CLASSES member ("quota",

# from a genuinely unclassified park. This required touching every hand-synced copy of the pinned
# vocabulary: ledger.py's REASON_CLASSES tuple, contract/vocabulary.json's "reason_classes"
# list (CONTRACT_VERSION unchanged -- contract/README.md's own version rule says adding a
# vocabulary member is additive, not breaking), and
# tests/test_ledger.py::test_vocabulary_constants_match_spec_table's pinned assertion. Reusing an
# EXISTING class instead (the only alternative that would have stayed inside this one file) would
# have been worse than "unknown": a quota-exhausted `gh issue close` is a failure of the remote
# SYSTEM, not a judgment about the goal's own state, so filing it under e.g. "dependency" or
# "needs_decision" would corrupt the recurrence signal the pinned vocabulary exists to protect
# (a downstream park-recurrence gap report) -- which is exactly why "quota" is
# also excluded from `_DECISION_TIER_REASON_CLASSES` below, the same posture as dependency/
# no_evidence/merge_conflict/failing_check/review_cap. The park event's `why` field already carried
# the full exception text verbatim via `detail` before this (see `_record`'s "source error recording
# 'done'" downgrade above); "quota" now makes that same fact aggregable as a `reason_class` bucket
# too, not just readable one park at a time. See test_reason_class_quota_detail_classifies_as_quota,
# which supersedes this issue's own predecessor test
# (test_reason_class_quota_detail_is_unknown_by_design) that pinned the old by-design behavior.

# #1185: the reason_classes whose text can carry a genuine human judgment call -- and therefore the
# only ones `_record` ever OFFERS to `decision_tier.resolve()` (see `_mechanical_unknown_detail`
# below for a second, finer-grained check inside "unknown" that this class-level gate alone does not
# capture). `needs_decision` is #953's original gate. `irreversible` joins it because that
# reason_class's own rule (above) fires FIRST and intercepts any detail containing "irreversible"
# before it can ever reach `needs_decision` -- meaning "irreversible" was dead code inside
# decision_tier's own `_PATTERNS` (one of its own escalate_l0 signal words, unreachable through the
# only caller) until this widened the gate. `unknown` joins it because that is the reason_class this
# module's OWN `_reason_class` docstring says every agent-typed `loop.py record ... parked "<free
# text>"` falls into when it matches none of the ~20 fixed substrings above -- i.e. it is A home of
# real decision prose decision_tier's vocabulary was written to classify (#818/#952's worked
# examples). BUT `unknown` is NOT a pure free-text bucket: it is ALSO where every one of work.py's
# OWN fixed, machine-generated park/gate-verdict messages lands, for the identical reason genuine
# free text does -- no `_REASON_CLASS_RULES` needle happens to cover their wording either
# (`work.MECHANICAL_PARK_PREFIXES`, #1240: gate()'s mergeability-retry line, an unreadable PR-state
# or local-branch-tip read, a missing headRefOid on either side, and an exhausted BEHIND rebase
# race, and as of #2009 the two stale-resume refusals). #1185's own review caught only the
# FIRST of those (mergeability) and excluded it with a
# single needle hardcoded a second time in this file -- leaving the others to fabricate a
# judgment tier on an ordinary infra hiccup exactly like real decision prose would, until #1240's

    `done`, and only after every piece of that goal's own bookkeeping has already landed.

    THE MECHANISM EXISTED; NOTHING CALLED IT. `work.finish()` has always done this correctly, but
    its only trigger was a sentence in `skills/agrim-loop/SKILL.md` ("After a `done`, release the
    checkout"), mid-paragraph in a block otherwise about `auto_merge` modes -- so it ran only when
    the agent read that line, was still alive after `record done`, and chose to act. Every turn
    that ended, crashed, compacted or was interrupted in between leaked a checkout permanently,
    because nothing ever looked at a closed goal again. Measured on this repo 2026-09-01: 33 live
    work records, 8 of 9 sampled goals CLOSED, 50 worktrees accumulated -- and since `finish()`
    unlinks the record on every successful path, it had demonstrably never run for any of them.
    A lifecycle step whose only trigger is prose has no reliability story (AGENTS.md: triggers live
    in Sigma's own Python, and a host hook may be an accelerator, never load-bearing).

    NOT A NEW POLICY. `work._open_pr_refusal`'s own docstring already states that SKILL.md routes a
    done "unconditionally to `finish`, with no wait step" -- this moves that documented,
    already-intended call out of prose and into the one chokepoint every terminal outcome passes
    through. What changes is that it now actually happens.

    CALLING IT UNCONDITIONALLY IS SAFE BECAUSE OF ITS REFUSALS, NOT DESPITE THEM. `finish` keeps a
    tree that still holds uncommitted work (a parked goal stays intact for whoever picks it up) and
    one whose PR is POSITIVELY CONFIRMED still OPEN and unarmed -- `state/work/<goal>.json` is the
    only place that PR number lives, and every later `merge`/`rebase`/`post-review` needs it
    (#1202). Both are fail-open: no `gh`, no network, an unreadable reply, a MERGED or a
    CLOSED-unmerged PR all proceed. No `work.enabled(config)` gate is added here for the same
    reason: with no record, `finish` returns "nothing to finish" without touching git, so it is
    already inert on a repo that never cuts checkouts.

    FAIL-OPEN, the same posture the `source.complete()` handler above takes. This is housekeeping
    layered on a terminal outcome already written to the ledger, the action log and the cursor; an
    exception must never propagate out of `_record` and turn a shipped goal into a traceback. The
    record survives a failure, so the state stays recoverable rather than half-erased.

    REPORTED, NOT SILENT. A checkout that was KEPT is the one case this deliberately does not clean

    THE DOCS HAVE ALWAYS DESCRIBED, finally existing.

    `skills/agrim-kg/SKILL.md`, `README.md` and `skills/agrim-retro/SKILL.md` all said the graph
    rebuilds itself at the end of every Retrospective. Nothing called a builder — `agrim-retro`'s §4
    even pointed at "this skill's own step 3 above" for a call step 3 never made. Measured on this
    repo 2026-09-02: `auto_refresh=True`, a 526-document corpus, `graph: not built`, and not one
    error anywhere to say so. That silence is the defect; a stale graph is only its symptom.

    A SUBPROCESS, NOT AN IMPORT. `kg.py` belongs to the sibling `agrim-kg` skill, and north-star
    Architecture Rule 3 is "skills do not import each other's Python — a skill needing a sibling
    shells out to that sibling's CLI". This is the same shape `_predict_model_tier` above already
    uses for `agrim-model`'s `predict.py`, down to the broad except and the non-fatal stderr line.
    (The checked-in plan for this issue proposed an `importlib` cross-load instead; that would have
    broken Rule 3, which nothing enforces structurally — `tests/test_import_boundary.py` covers only
    the core↔private-side boundary.)

    HOST-AGNOSTIC BY CONSTRUCTION. It is Python on the terminal outcome path that every host reaches,
    not a hook: Cursor has none, and `/agrim-loop` and `/agrim-goal` both end a goal through `record`.

    ONLY STDERR IS FORWARDED, and that is the whole reporting design. `kg.py refresh` sends a
    correctly-gated no-op to stdout and anything else — a real build, or any failure — to stderr, so
    a repo that never turned the graph on stays completely silent while a refresh that DIED is
    visible on the console. Fail-open throughout: this runs after the goal's bookkeeping has already

    """#232: finish the goals `record review` left waiting -- the "issue closes when the PR merges"
    half of done-means-merged. -> [(goal, outcome, pr)] for each goal this pass RECORDED.

    For each work record flagged `awaiting_merge` (oldest-checked first, at most
    `work.MERGE_RECONCILE_MAX_PER_PASS`, skipping any re-read within `min_interval` seconds):
    one REST read of its PR (`work.pr_landing_state`), then
      merged          -> `work.done_refusal` given THAT read (replays the merge receipt: the
                         existing merge-observation adapter) and `_record(done, merged_pr=True)`,
                         which closes the issue, strips the lifecycle labels, moves the card to Done
                         and releases the checkout -- the same chokepoint a `record done` passes;
      closed unmerged -> `_record(parked, "PR #N was closed without merging")` -- a human closed
                         it, so a human decides;
      open / unknown  -> stamp `checked_at` and leave it.

    ONE PASS AT A TIME (#255 (2)): the whole pass runs under `_merge_reconcile_lock`; a pass that
    finds it held skips (stderr names the holder pid) -- the holder is doing this work.

    CRASH-SAFE (#255 (3)): `_record` clears the flag itself, immediately after its ledger terminal
    entry and BEFORE the slow tail (unit-completion signal, checkout release), so a pass killed in
    that tail by the watch tick's timeout never records `done` a second time. A kill before the
    record (during the close) leaves the flag, and the next pass retries; `complete()` is safe on an
    already-closed issue. And the pass is BOUNDED in time: no goal is started once
    `_merge_reconcile_budget()` (half of SIGMA_WATCH_CALL_TIMEOUT) is spent.

    QUIET RETRY (#255 (7)): a raising `complete()` records nothing and parks nothing on the first
    MERGE_CLOSE_ATTEMPTS - 1 failures (counted on the flag); the MERGE_CLOSE_ATTEMPTS-th parks in
    public, once. A `done` downgraded that way keeps the flag, so the close is still retried.

    COST (#255 (1), measured by tests/test_merge_reconcile.py): zero `gh` calls when nothing is
    flagged (one directory listing). Otherwise one REST `pulls/<n>` GET per goal read, at most
    `limit` per pass whatever the backlog, and no `gh pr view` (GraphQL) at all: the confirming read
    is reused and `finish` is told the merge is confirmed. A goal that closes adds one more REST read
    only when the ledger or journal is on (the merge facts), plus the issue GraphQL reads and writes
    `source.complete()` makes for any `record done`. A larger backlog costs close LATENCY (every PR
    re-read within ceil(N/limit) passes), never more calls per pass.

    Only on `work.enabled` (no PR is ever opened otherwise). FAIL-OPEN per goal and overall: a sweep
    must never cost the caller its pick or its tick."""

    picking it — `sdlc:in-progress` added (GitHub) or `status: in_progress` written (local). If the
    caller then never calls `record` on that SAME goal — next-batch picked more than got dispatched
    this run, or a later pick was `--skip`ped after an earlier one already claimed it — nothing
    ever undoes that claim: the label/status sticks forever with no sanctioned way to clear it, so
    an operator had to hand-run `gh issue edit --remove-label` plus write their own comment
    (observed live on #813/#815/#817/#821). This is the sanctioned replacement: `source.release`
    does the actual undo (the label/board-status reset + audit comment, or the local status flip +
    journey note), then this records the SAME `release` ledger kind `_held()` now treats as ending
    an open claim (`ledger.KINDS` declared it from the start, but nothing ever wrote it before this
    verb existed), mirrors it to the local action log, and clears any agent-death-watch marker for
    this goal — the same bookkeeping trio `_record()` runs for a real terminal outcome.

    Deliberately NEVER touches `state.advance_cursor`: unlike `_record()`, a release is not a
    completed iteration (the goal was never actually worked), so it must not consume a slot of
    `budget.max_iterations` — the goal remains exactly as pending as it was before it was ever
    picked, and a fresh `next`/`next-batch` call in the SAME run can pick it right back up.

    POST-REVIEW FIX (PR #1107, Finding 3): `source.release()` now returns True/False (did it
    actually release a claim, or was the goal/issue already done/parked/failed — a clean no-op).
    Returned here unchanged so the CLI layer can print a clear, non-fatal message instead of
    claiming a release happened when it did not. Additive only: no caller predating this read the
    return value, and the ledger/action-log/agent_end bookkeeping below stays UNCONDITIONAL exactly
    as before a no-op release is harmless to record — `ledger._held()`'s own actor-scoped claim view
    (Finding 2's fix) only ever ends a lease still attributed to the SAME actor, so a stray
    `release` entry for a goal with no open claim (or one held by someone else) is a no-op there
    too, never a false "un-claim". `agent_end` is always safe to call regardless (see its own
    docstring: "Safe no-op if nothing to clear").

    `claim_actor` (PR #1235 review, Finding 1/3): OPTIONAL, and ONLY ever passed by
    `_auto_reclaim_stale_claims` — the actor the LEDGER itself recorded as holding the claim being
    reclaimed (from `ledger.expired_claims()`'s own return value), never operator/CLI-typed. The
    CLI `release` verb (this function's other caller, below) never passes it, so a human-run
    `release` writes byte-identical to before this fix. Threaded through to
    `ledger.safe_append(..., reclaimed_actor=...)` so the release entry's OWN `actor` field stays
    an honest, self-attributed record of who actually performed the reclaim (this process), while
    still letting `ledger._held()` durably end the ORIGINAL claimant's lease — see that function's
    own docstring for why the plain actor-scoped check alone could never do this for a genuinely
    cross-actor reclaim, and why naming the target this way does not reopen the #1107 hazard.

    `claim_run` (PR #1269 review, blocking finding 1): the same pattern, one axis finer — OPTIONAL,
    ONLY ever passed by `_auto_reclaim_stale_claims`, sourced from `ledger.expired_claim_run_ids()`'s
    own return value (the STALE claim's own `run_id`, snapshotted at the same moment as
    `claim_actor`, never re-derived after). Threaded through to `reclaimed_run` so `ledger._held()`
    can tell the claim actually being reclaimed apart from the SAME actor's own live re-claim by a
    DIFFERENT, concurrent process — see `ledger._held()`'s own docstring for the exact race this
    closes. `None` for the CLI `release` verb, exactly like `claim_actor` — a human-run release
    writes byte-identical to before this fix."""

    skip a goal that is ITSELF a decomposition child or meta-goal (first line of the BODY only —
    see the anchoring note below), then classify what is left with `goal_size.classify` — a
    deterministic, zero-LLM heuristic. `log`/`park` never file anything; `file` additionally opens
    ONE idempotency-guarded "Decompose #N" meta-issue (#522) — even so, the actual decomposition
    (drafting child goals) always runs LATER as its own normal SDLC goal, protected by the same
    plan-review/budget/claims machinery every goal already gets. This verb only ever detects, and
    in `file` mode also files a tracking issue for that later goal to act on — it never decomposes
    anything itself.

    runs). FAIL-OPEN: any error BEFORE a park decision is made, INCLUDING a config value so
    malformed the guard itself cannot evaluate it (e.g. `goal_decompose: "on"` instead of a dict —
    `.get` on a non-dict raises), returns 'PROCEED' with one stderr line — this check must never
    block or crash the loop, matching `precheck`'s own "gate inside the guard" idiom: disabled /
    absent / falsy-malformed short-circuits to 'OFF' with no warning, only a genuinely ill-typed
    value reaches the outer catch. Once a park decision IS made, that guarantee flips: `_record`'s
    own bookkeeping (cursor/ledger/actionlog) is wrapped in its OWN try/except (the `_park` helper
    below, R9/#522 — the ONE place every `park`-mode and `file`-mode exit routes through), separate
    from the outer one, so a failure there — AFTER `source.park` has already gone out — still
    reports 'PARKED', never downgrades to 'PROCEED'. `file` mode's own multi-step sequence (steps
    1-4 below) carries the identical guarantee one level up: it runs inside its OWN inner
    try/except, so ANY failure partway through — even `create_tracked_issue` unexpectedly raising,
    breaking its own documented "never raises" contract — still reaches `_park`, never the outer
    catch (a caller reading PROCEED would go implement the very epic-shaped goal this feature
    exists to catch, possibly on top of a real GitHub issue this run already filed against it).

    Anchoring: the refusal guards match ONLY the first line of the BODY (`.splitlines()[:1]`,
    CRLF-tolerant) — never the title, and never a marker that only appears further down the body —
    so a goal merely discussing decomposition in passing is not exempted by accident.

    Deliberate asymmetry, not drift (#521 review): this guard reads the RAW, unstripped body's first
    line, so a body starting with a blank line sees an empty first line and is NOT exempted here.
    `backlog_check`'s own dedup exemption (its `exempt` computation, backlog_check.py:427-432) instead
    reads the first NON-BLANK line of the stripped excerpt, because local-mode bodies always start
    with a blank line after the frontmatter delimiter. Net effect: a body opening with a blank line
    before its marker is dedup-exempt in `backlog_check` but still fully classified by this guard —
    a recorded decision, not an inconsistency to fix.

    mode: 'log' (default once enabled) classifies + annotates via the local action log, zero
    mutation ever. 'park' parks a flagged goal (`_record`, the same chokepoint every other outcome
    goes through) for a human to split. 'file' (#522) parks too, but FIRST attempts to file ONE
    idempotency-guarded "Decompose #N" meta-issue via `handoff.create_tracked_issue`: a strict read
    (`source.fetch_comments_strict`) checks the parent's own comments for a prior
    `sigma:decompose-filed` marker first — that read failing, returning a malformed shape, or
    the source not offering it at all, all fail CLOSED to a park, never silently treated as "no
    marker". This makes a re-run that gets AS FAR AS THE MARKER safe against double-filing; it is
    NOT an absolute guarantee — a hard crash strictly between the create call landing and the
    marker comment going out (not an ordinary exception, which is already caught and parked) can
    still leave one meta-issue with no marker yet, so a later re-pick could file a second one. The
    meta-goal template's own step 0 (lower-number-wins) is the mitigation for that residual case,
    not a claim it cannot occur. A backlog source with no issue-creation seam at all
    (`hasattr(source, "create_dependency")` false — e.g. `LocalSource`) degrades honestly to the
    same visible `park` action, never a false "failed to file" park with nothing behind it. An
    unrecognized mode string warns once to stderr and falls back to 'log' — the printed result
    always stays inside the OFF | PARKED | PROCEED vocabulary above, never `None`."""

def design_check(sdlc_dir, goal, config, source):
    """Pre-work undesigned-goal RETROFIT gate (OPT-IN via `goal_design.enabled is True`, #1825),
    mirroring `decompose_check`'s own `file`-mode shape one section up — the Tech-side half of
    `docs/dossier-pipeline.md` §6 (the retrofit gate). Before a picked goal spends a
    token: unless it already carries `sdlc:designed`, park it and file ONE idempotency-guarded
    "Design #N" meta-issue instructing a codebase-mapping design pass (`skills/agrim-goal-design/
    SKILL.md`) — the coverage mechanism that closes the gap named in the contract's own §2: nothing
    skips the blast-radius mapping just by being born outside the Dossier (Product-path) front door.

    Placed in SKILL.md step 3 directly AFTER `decompose_check`, for the identical ordering reason
    `decompose_check` itself is placed after `precheck`: a goal that is BOTH oversized AND undesigned
    must be split first, so each eventual child gets its OWN design check individually, rather than
    one design pass being filed against a goal about to be decomposed out from under it.

    Returns a one-line result the SKILL reads by its first word: 'OFF' (disabled) | 'PARKED
    <reason>' (parked — a "Design #N" meta-issue was filed, or filing itself could not be confirmed
    safe; do not research it, take the next goal) | 'PROCEED' (already `sdlc:designed`, or a pure
    bookkeeping meta-goal exempt by construction). FAIL-OPEN for anything BEFORE the label/comment
    read below (disabled / absent / a goal whose title+body cannot be fetched at all all short-
    circuit to 'PROCEED', matching `precheck`/`decompose_check`'s own "gate inside the guard" idiom)
    — this check must never block or crash the loop on an ordinary transient failure. FAIL-CLOSED,
    deliberately unlike that default, for the ONE read this whole feature depends on: once `source.
    fetch_comments_strict` has been called, a failure OR a malformed shape parks rather than
    proceeds — an unreadable label set must never be treated as "already designed", exactly the
    reasoning `decompose_check`'s own idempotency read already applies to "no marker found" (see its
    docstring) — collapsing that ambiguity into PROCEED would silently reopen the coverage hole this
    feature exists to close. Once a park decision IS made, `_record`'s own bookkeeping is wrapped in
    its OWN try/except (the `_park` helper below, mirroring `decompose_check`'s R9), so a failure
    there — AFTER `source.park` has already gone out — still reports 'PARKED', never 'PROCEED'.

    Exemption (first BODY line only, CRLF-tolerant, same anchoring as `decompose_check`):
    `goal_size.DECOMPOSE_OF_MARKER` or `design_goal.DESIGN_OF_MARKER` — a pure bookkeeping
    meta-issue (decompose's own, or this check's own) is never itself design-worthy. Deliberately
    NOT `goal_size.DECOMPOSED_FROM_MARKER` — a decompose CHILD is a real, independently-implementable
    slice with no blast-radius mapping of its own; exempting it would defeat the coverage guarantee
    this feature exists to provide (contract §2's stated gap: `goal_decompose`'s classifier measures
    size, never blast radius).

    `mode`: `"full"` (default once enabled — the contract's own stated default depth, §6a) |
    `"lane"` (a cheaper, lane-sized check for smaller retrofit goals, reusing `discovery.py`'s
    small/medium/large concept). Unlike `goal_decompose.mode`'s three values (log/park/file, which
    pick the ACTION), this axis never changes what `design_check` DOES — once enabled it always
    park-and-files — it only changes the DEPTH instructions rendered into the filed meta-issue's own
    body (`design_goal.render_meta_body`). An unrecognized mode string warns once to stderr and
    falls back to `"lane"` — the least-invasive rung, mirroring `decompose_check`'s own fallback
    MECHANISM (not its literal default value, since the two `mode` axes mean different things)."""

    commits behind origin/main is byte-indistinguishable from one verified against its own code.

    That is not hypothetical. On 2026-09-01 six merged goals were verified against exactly that
    stale checkout: it collects 3539 tests where the current tree collects 4077, six of them failed,

    a green status file is not freshness.

    Called from the three verbs that resolve a genuinely stable session pid AND can reach
    `_emit_run_stop_once` -- `start`, `next`, `next-batch`. Setting the env var rather than
    threading a parameter is what keeps the diff at zero signature changes: `state.run_identity()`

    the reclaim append, `_auto_reclaim_stale_claims`, and `state.done_refusal`), and all five see
    one consistent value for the rest of this process.

    NOT a central pre-parse in `_dispatch`. `--session-pid` is parsed per-verb here, and `record`
    disambiguates positionally (`argv[5]` is a freeform reason), so a shared `_flags(argv[3:])`
    ahead of dispatch would misparse it.

    `supervise.sh` STILL WINS: an already-exported id is never overwritten. Its id is stable across

    the real production chokepoint (both the CLI `next` verb and `run_loop` pass through `_next()`,
    so wiring it here covers both drivers with one edit; `#547`'s `_emit_run_stop` above had no
    production caller — the live loop is CLI `next`/`record`-driven, never in-process `run_loop`).

    Three gates, in the order the code below actually checks them (PR-review correction: an
    earlier revision of this docstring listed dedupe before degradation; degradation genuinely
    runs SECOND, dedupe third, and that order is deliberate — see point 2):
    1. ATTRIBUTION — only emit when `state.run_identity()` is not `None`. An unattributed session
       (no `SIGMA_RUN_ID`: any interactive/direct `/agrim-loop` session not wrapped in
       `supervise.sh`) is skipped, not recorded under a shared `None` key — a durable "at most one
       row per identity" guard keyed on `None` would let the FIRST unattributed run ever claim
       that key and silently suppress every later unattributed run's real stop, forever.
       `done_refusal` already has this exact precedent (`state.py`'s own docstring: "degrades to
       the pre-#498 freshness-only behaviour" when unattributed) rather than inventing unsafe
       cross-process coordination for a case #498 already decided not to support.
    2. DEGRADATION (reason_class == 'backlog-empty' only) — `source.read_degraded()`, when the
       source exposes it (`GithubSource` does; nothing else needs to — `getattr(..., lambda: False)`
       defaults any other source to "not degraded"), distinguishes a genuinely drained backlog from
       a masked read failure (`sources.py`'s own `_fetch_pending` returns `(0, None)`/`(N, None)`
       for both). A degraded read skips the emit entirely: an honest absence, never a possibly-false
       'backlog-empty' row. Checked BEFORE the dedupe claim below on purpose: a degraded read must
       never burn that drain's claim slot, or a later, genuinely successful read in the SAME drain
       (a retried poll) would find the slot already taken and stay silently unrecorded too. The
       `BUDGET` branch needs no equivalent guard — `_budget_reason()` is a deterministic local
       computation over `state.load_cursor`, independent of the (possibly-failing) remote backlog
       read; `_next()` only ever reaches the budget check after a goal was already found via a
       successful read.
    3. DEDUPE — `state.claim_run_stop`, keyed on `(run_id, run_started_at)`, not the bare run id
       alone (see its own docstring for why: `run_id` is stable across a whole `supervise.sh`
       worker's lifetime, INCLUDING every budget-stop-then-relaunch cycle, so a bare-id key would
       silently drop every terminal event after the first one ever reached under that id). Repeated
       `next` polling within one unchanged drain (no intervening `start`/`start-run`) shares one
       `run_started_at` and so dedupes to one row — the original concern in #905's own issue body
       ("the polled 'next' verb... would emit a duplicate... on every idle poll"). A relaunch

#: #140 (amendment A): the ONLY kinds `emit` will write — a POSITIVE allowlist, not merely
#: "whatever ledger.EVENT_KINDS accepts". `verify`/`slice`/`park`/`scan` are Class-1 events
#: written exclusively by deterministic code (verify_goal, slices.py, pipeline.py, `record`'s
#: own park path) — an agent typing `emit ... verify --ok true --exit 0` must never be able to
#: fabricate a "tests passed" record byte-indistinguishable from a real one. `emit` only ever
#: owns the four kinds #140's SKILL.md prose actually instructs.
#:
#: issue #1030 adds a fifth: `model_choice`, written by `skills/agrim-model/scripts/predict.py`'s
#: own `resolve`/`resolve_step` shelling out to this same `emit` verb, before returning, so a
#: goal's predicted model tier reaches the ledger unconditionally rather than depending on a
#: calling skill's SKILL.md remembering a second instruction (the exact pattern #1013 found
#: failing for `agrim-retro`'s own prose-only `emit retro` line: zero events recorded across 559
#: ledger files). NOT given reliability class 1 downstream despite being code-driven: unlike verify/slice/
#: park/scan above, `model_choice` IS reachable through this same agent-facing `emit` CLI (that is
#: the whole point -- predict.py calls the SAME command an agent could type by hand), so an agent
#: typing `emit ... model_choice --model opus --signal "fake"` directly is exactly as possible as
#: it is for `phase`/`gate`/`retro`/`spend` above -- marking it class 1 would reopen the identical
#: forgery hole this allowlist exists to close. Stays at the class-2 default, same as its four
#: siblings here.
_EMIT_KINDS = ("phase", "gate", "retro", "spend", "model_choice")

#: Within `_EMIT_KINDS`, `gate` is narrowed AGAIN. `ledger.GATE_KINDS` has 13 members; the ones
#: written at all (merge, decision, code_review, post_review, test_trust — and, since #910,
#: risk_migration/risk_contract/risk_security) are emitted deterministically by shipped code, from a
#: measured verdict — letting `emit` write `--gate merge --verdict pass` would forge a Class-1 "this
#: PR merged clean" record. #140 owns exactly two: the plan-review verdict and the periodic
#: alignment check.
#:
#: #910 DELIBERATELY DID NOT WIDEN THIS. Its emitter (`work.py`'s `_emit_risk_gates`) derives both
#: the gate and the verdict from risk-detect.sh's output and takes neither from an argument, so it
#: needed no agent-typable `--gate risk_security` to exist — and adding one would hand an agent the
#: forged `risk_security pass` this allowlist exists to prevent. Pinned by
#: tests/test_risk_gate_events.py::test_loop_emit_still_refuses_a_hand_typed_risk_gate.

def _validate_event(kind, flags, kind_allowlist=None):
    """The one refusal check shared by `emit` and the extended `spend` verb's event path (#140
    PR-review findings 1+2). `spend` calls this with `kind_allowlist=None` — it legitimately
    always writes the `spend` kind, chosen by code, never by an agent-supplied argument, so
    there is nothing to allowlist there; `emit` passes `_EMIT_KINDS` because its `kind` IS
    agent-supplied.

    Checks, in order:
      1. kind allowlist (only when `kind_allowlist` is given)
      2. unknown flag NAMES against `ledger.EVENT_FIELDS[kind]`
      3. #141: a raw newline in ANY flag value — not only the declared prose fields (`why`/
         `model`). Scoping to "any flag" needs no second declared list here, is a strict superset
         of "reject newlines in why/model", and changes nothing for a field that would already
         fail the vocabulary checks below on a `\n`-corrupted value. This is deliberately a HARD
         REJECT (exit 2, nothing written) — unlike `append()`'s own flatten-only treatment, which
         must never reject because it also sits behind the three deterministic, fail-open call
         sites (a hook's `deny`, an autonomous park). `emit`/`spend` are synchronous, explicitly-
         typed CLI verbs that already return an exit code for bad input, so a hard rule is safe
         here specifically. Uses `ledger.reject_newline` — the shared helper `work.py`'s
         post-review branch also calls, so the two never drift into near-identical hand-written
         copies of the same rule again.
      4. POST-REVIEW FIX (THE LEAK): a declared-NUMERIC field whose value does not parse as an
         int, or a declared-BOOL field whose value isn't a recognised spelling — checked by FIELD
         name against `ledger.EVENT_NUMERIC_FIELDS[kind]` / `ledger.EVENT_BOOL_FIELDS[kind]`. An
         independent review proved by execution that `tokens_in`/`cycle`/`debt_count` (declared
         "safe" only because they weren't prose) were plain CLI strings with ZERO shape
         enforcement — a payload with no literal newline sailed through with a full secret inside.
         This is the CLI's clear, actionable half of the fix (exit 2, a usable message); the
         `append()` chokepoint enforces the same rule again as the fail-open backstop for the call
         sites that never reach a CLI at all.
      5. out-of-vocabulary VALUES, checked by FIELD name (not by `kind`) for every
         vocabulary-bearing field present in `flags` — `phase`/`gate`/`verdict`/`grade`/`state`.
         By-field (not by-kind) is what closes finding 1: `EVENT_FIELDS["spend"]` carries a
         `phase` field with the identical `PHASE_KINDS` vocabulary as `phase`-kind events, so a
         future kind that also carries `phase` inherits this check automatically instead of
         needing its own `kind == "..."` branch.
