"""Read side of the local-only action log (skills/agrim-loop/scripts/actionlog.py writes it, opt-in
via config `action_log.enabled`). Zero-dep, ZERO import of actionlog.py — reads the same JSONL
format independently, format-only coupling, exactly `agrim-status`'s own relationship to `state.py`'s
STATE.md ("the two skills are independently installable units; sharing a lib across them would
over-couple them").

Answers, from the log alone, no live agent inspection needed:
  status <dir>            -- "where are we right now" (every ACTIVE goal, newest activity first)
  goal <dir> <goal>        -- "which thread, what's the status on THIS (possibly large) goal"
  slots <dir>              -- the same ACTIVE-goal derivation as Block A of docs/output-contract.md

A goal counts as ACTIVE (for `status`) iff its file has a `claimed` entry and its last entry,
across every thread, is not `recorded` (a `recorded result=review` — PR awaiting merge, #255 — is
still active: done means merged) — purely log-derived, no ledger read, no liveness probe
(that is a different, deliberately out-of-scope watcher). `status` prints "last activity: <N> ago"
precisely so a human can judge staleness themselves, never a liveness claim this tool can't back
up. An empty/absent `.sdlc/state/log/` is a legitimate, obviously-off state, reported as a one-line
empty state pointing at `action_log.enabled`, never an error.

`slots` (#2113) RENDERS THAT SAME DERIVATION AS BLOCK A, and adds no derivation of its own: the
ACTIVE set, its ordering and its "N ago" all come from `active()` above, unchanged. What it adds is
the six contract fields per slot, the six-slot ceiling, and — the part that matters most — an
honest answer when it has nothing to say.

  THREE STATES, NOT TWO. `action_log.enabled` defaults to FALSE and the log is local-only and
  gitignored, so "no rows" has three different causes and they are three different facts:

    off        the config was read and says the log is not on -> `action log off -- slot detail
               unavailable`. It claims NOTHING about what is in flight, because it knows nothing.
    unknown    the config could not be read at all (no `config.json` — which is exactly what a
               goal WORKTREE looks like) -> `action log state unknown`. Reporting that as "off"
               would be #1778's defect verbatim: a check that read "file missing" as "this project
               has none" when the file was merely unreachable from a worktree.
    on         the config says the log is on, and the block that follows is what the log holds —
               including the two empty cases (nothing logged yet / logged but nothing active),
               which are again separate lines, because they are separate facts.

  NO ARROW, EVER. §3 asks a slot description to end `→ <what unblocks next>` "whenever there is a
  next thing to name — never invent one where there is not" (#2124 settled that exception). This
  log records what HAPPENED; it has no record of what unblocks anything. So no description built
  here carries an arrow, and the tail says so in one line rather than leaving a reader to wonder.

  THE MARKER COMES OFF CODE-WRITTEN ENTRIES ONLY. `actionlog.INTERNAL_KINDS` cannot be reached
  from any CLI; `AGENT_KINDS` are whatever an agent typed. A liveness marker read off an agent row
  would launder a claim into a measurement (design .sdlc/design/2030.md, D-2) — and would also be
  wrong in practice, since a finished goal's log routinely ends with an `agent_done` written after
  the code's own `recorded`.

  NO PHASE MEANS NO SLOT LINE. §2: "The phase is always present. If you genuinely cannot name one,
  the work is not in the SDLC and does not belong in a slot line." Only agent-emitted rows carry a
  `phase`, so a goal may genuinely have none — those goals are WITHHELD and COUNTED in the tail,
  never given an inferred phase. The loop's first phase is not derivable from `claimed`.

  THE SHAPE IS RENDER.PY'S JOB, NOT THIS MODULE'S. `skills/agrim-loop/scripts/render.py` is SHELLED
  OUT (never imported — this skill imports nothing from `skills/agrim-loop/scripts/`, and render.py
  loads no sibling of its own so that it can be run from here with no `sys.path` dance). This
  module therefore does NOT re-validate what render.py validates: a ref, a URL or a title this
  module hands over malformed comes back as a typed REFUSAL, and that refusal is REPORTED — on
  stdout, verbatim, with its code — beside the facts, never swallowed and never hand-shaped into a
  look-alike block. A refusal costs you the SHAPE; it must never cost you the FACTS.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------- Block A (#2113)

#: `skills/agrim-loop/scripts/render.py` — the ONE module that constructs a status line (#2111).
#: SHELLED OUT, never imported: this skill deliberately imports nothing from
#: `skills/agrim-loop/scripts/` (see `_unsafe_goal_reason` and the module docstring), and render.py
#: loads no sibling script of its own precisely so it can be run from here with no `sys.path`
#: dance. Same relative-path convention `skills/agrim-model/scripts/predict.py` already uses in the
#: other direction, and the same one every `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../agrim-loop/scripts/...` line in
#: this kit's SKILL.md files uses.
RENDER_PY = (pathlib.Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent.parent
             / "agrim-loop" / "scripts" / "render.py")

#: The three states `action_log.enabled` can be in — see the module docstring on why "off" and
#: "unknown" must not collapse into one.
LOG_ON, LOG_OFF, LOG_UNKNOWN = "on", "off", "unknown"

#: The exact wording issue #2113 specifies for the off state. It is a statement of IGNORANCE, not
#: a report of emptiness: nothing here has looked at a single log file when this line is printed.
OFF_LINE = "action log off -- slot detail unavailable"

#: Its sibling for a config that could not be READ. Same consequence, different cause, and a
#: reader has to be able to tell them apart — the whole point of #1778.
UNKNOWN_LINE = "action log state unknown -- slot detail unavailable"

#: `actionlog.INTERNAL_KINDS`, verbatim — the kinds only a Python call site can write, never
#: reachable from any CLI, so an agent cannot forge one. Copied rather than imported (format-only
#: coupling, module docstring); `test_code_written_kinds_match_the_writers_own_list` pins the two
#: lists together so a kind added there and missed here turns a test red rather than silently
#: demoting a goal's marker.
CODE_WRITTEN_KINDS = ("claimed", "worktree_start", "verify_run", "recorded", "gate",
                      "merge_armed", "merged", "decompose_check", "released", "agent_reclaimed")

#: The §2 phase vocabulary (`ledger.PHASE_KINDS`, and the kind half of `render.PHASE_TOKENS`).
#: Copied for the same reason; pinned by `test_phase_kinds_match_the_renderers_own_table`. Values
#: OUTSIDE it that appear in real logs (`code_review`, `pr_review` — sub-agent roles written before
#: `loop.py log` began enforcing the vocabulary) are NOT §2 phases and are never mapped onto one.
PHASE_KINDS = ("goal", "research", "plan", "plan_review", "implement", "review", "retro")

#: §2 Axis 1, read off the newest CODE-WRITTEN entry. Only three kinds say more than "something is
#: happening": a claim with no code-written action after it IS §2's "claimed, not started";
#: `merge_armed`/`merged` are §2's "approved; merge handler or CI in flight". `🟣 review` is
#: deliberately unreachable — a `gate` row records a verdict a gate ALREADY returned, never a
#: review in flight, and stamping one from it would be a claim the log cannot back.
MARKER_BY_KIND = {"claimed": "queued", "merge_armed": "merging", "merged": "merging"}

#: `recorded` carries the outcome the loop itself wrote, so it is the one row that can honestly
#: close a slot. Anything other than these two — `failed`, or a result this table has not seen — is
#: `blocked`, §2's "failed, or needs a human decision", never silently `running`.
MARKER_BY_RESULT = {"done": "done", "parked": "parked", "review": "review"}   # #232: PR awaits merge
MARKER_RECORDED_OTHER = "blocked"

#: What a goal gets when no code-written row says more: work is in flight. Also the answer when
#: the log holds ONLY agent rows, because that is genuinely all that is known.
MARKER_DEFAULT = "running"

#: §3: "Max 6 slots. More than 6 means collapse, not scroll." Collapse here is exact and stated:
#: the six MOST RECENTLY ACTIVE goals are rendered and the remainder is COUNTED in the tail, so the
#: block never grows past six lines of slot and the reader is never left to guess how many they are
#: not being shown. Pinned to `render.MAX_SLOTS` by
#: `test_the_slot_ceiling_and_title_cap_match_the_renderers`.
MAX_SLOTS = 6

#: §3: "Title ≤ 88 characters", and 88 is `phase_report.TITLE_MAX` — the producer's own bound. This
#: module is a producer, so it ELIDES at the cap with a visible `…` exactly as
#: `phase_report.clean_title` does, rather than handing render.py a title it must refuse.
TITLE_MAX_CHARS = 88

#: What a title field says when no source ON THIS MACHINE knows the title. `title` is required and
#: not nullable in render.py's fact set, so the absence has to be SAID; the manner is
#: `render.TIER_UNRECORDED`'s and `phase_report`'s `cost: unavailable on this host (<reason>)`.
TITLE_UNAVAILABLE = "title unavailable on this host"

#: `mirror.MIRROR_REL` / `phase_report.MIRROR_REL` — the gitignored NDJSON snapshot of the backlog
#: that the pick which claimed a goal already wrote. READ, never fetched: this command makes no
#: network call, on any host.
MIRROR_REL = "state/board-mirror.ndjson"

#: How far into the mirror to scan before giving up. `mirror.py` caps itself at 200 open + 200
#: recently-closed records, so a complete file is ~400 lines; 4,000 is a factor of ten of headroom
#: over that and still O(1) work per slot at any backlog size. A miss prints the honest
#: `TITLE_UNAVAILABLE`, which is what an unmirrored goal already gets.
MIRROR_SCAN_LINES = 4000

#: §3: "Description ≤ 20 words." Enforced HERE as well as in render.py, and not as belt-and-braces:
#: this module composes the description, so a description that cannot fit is this module's bug to
#: handle, not a reason for one odd goal to cost the whole block its shape.
DESCRIPTION_MAX_WORDS = 20

#: Each field VALUE in a description is collapsed to one line and elided here. A log value is
#: capped at 500 characters by the writer, which is four sentences — far past what a ≤20-word line
#: can hold.
VALUE_MAX_CHARS = 32

#: Said out loud when the two lines above still are not enough (a value carrying a dozen spaces).
#: The reduction is VISIBLE: a reader must be able to tell a short description from a shortened
#: one, and the full entry is one `log.py goal <id>` away.
ELIDED = "(fields elided)"

#: The fields of each log kind that are BOUNDED enough to sit in a ≤20-word line, in the order they
#: are printed. Deliberately a subset of `actionlog.ALL_FIELDS`: every free-text field is left out
#: (`gate.why` and `recorded.detail` are routinely whole paragraphs, `note.text` is arbitrary), and
#: leaving them out is a display choice, not a data loss — `log.py goal <id>` still prints all of
#: it. A kind this table does not know renders as the bare kind, which is what keeps a NEW
#: actionlog kind from breaking this reader (the exact cross-skill failure #1626's own retro
#: recorded).

    174 hours earlier, because a `recorded` goal stays in `active()`'s set forever once any row
    lands after it. That derivation is not this module's to change (issue filed separately). WHICH
    SIX THE CAP TAKES is presentation, and it is.

    THE RULE: while anything is in flight, the slots are ITS. A closed goal is counted in the tail,
    never shown. With nothing in flight there is nothing to displace, so the most recently closed
    fill the block and the HEADLINE says that is what they are.

    WHY NOT "closed goals may take the slots in-flight goals leave free", which is the obvious
    softer rule: it was written, run against this repo's real log, and DEFEATED THERE. One goal
    (#495) sat in flight with its last activity 200 hours old — claimed and never `recorded`, so
    in-flight by the log's own account — and every "is this recent enough" boundary derived from
    the live set stretched to 200 hours with it, letting five goals that had finished a week
    earlier back into the block. A rule that a single stale claim can switch off is not a rule.
    This one has no boundary to stretch.

    Nothing is lost by it. §5's trigger table already routes a landing to Block B ("A merge lands →
    B"); finished work is that block's job, and Block A is the live view. And a closed goal is
