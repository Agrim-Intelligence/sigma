"""Add a `Ready` lane to an EXISTING GitHub Projects v2 board, without wiping card Status (#696).

New boards Sigma creates already carry the six lanes (`Backlog | Ready | In Progress | QC |
Done | Blocked`). An existing board — every current adopter, including this repo's own project #6 —
has no `Ready` option, which is precisely what keeps it on the historical label queue: `sources.py`'s
`_ready_lane()` returns None and nothing changes. This script is the deliberate, human-invoked way
to opt such a board in.

It is NOT reachable from any loop path, by construction: nothing imports it, no hook calls it, and
it does nothing at all unless a human names the project on the command line and adds `--apply`.

    python3 board_migrate.py --owner <login|@me> --project <number>            # dry run (default)
    python3 board_migrate.py --owner <login|@me> --project <number> --apply

WHY ITS OWN OPTION BUILDER, rather than reusing `sources._options_mutation`: verified on a
throwaway project before this was written —

    [2] append option WITH ids -> card keeps Status:   PASS (status='In Progress')
    [3] rewrite WITHOUT ids    -> card LOSES Status:   PASS (status=None)

`ProjectV2SingleSelectFieldOptionInput` accepts an `id`. Re-send every existing option with its id
and cards keep their Status; omit the ids and every card's Status is wiped to null. `sources.py`'s
builder omits them — correct for a board the kit creates from scratch, catastrophic for an adopted
one. That is also why `_ensure_status_field`'s `created_now` gate must never be relaxed.

Additive only: an existing option is never removed or renamed, and its colour and description ride
along so the board's appearance is not silently reset.
