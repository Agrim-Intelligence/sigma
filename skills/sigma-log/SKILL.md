## Codex path resolution

Codex has no `CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR`. In each command, replace `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` with the
absolute directory of this installed `SKILL.md` (shown in the skill catalog); never run an
empty path. Claude keeps its provided value.

# sigma-log

Detailed selection triggers: [selection](references/selection.md).

Read side of the **local-only action log** (`skills/sigma-loop/scripts/actionlog.py` writes it,
opt-in via config `action_log.enabled`, default `false`) — a full-granularity trace of file
touches, model/effort choices, subagent dispatch, and every mechanically-guaranteed loop action
(claim/worktree/verify/gate/record), kept entirely separate from the team ledger and never
committed (`.sdlc/state/log/`, already gitignored via the existing `RUNTIME_IGNORES` mechanism).
This skill only ever READS `.sdlc/state/log/*.jsonl`; it shares no code with the writer.

For **"where are we right now"**, run
`python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/log.py" status .sdlc` and relay the output. It lists every
ACTIVE goal (claimed, and not yet recorded done/parked/failed), newest activity first, one line per
`(goal, thread)` with its most recent action and how long ago it happened. A goal that has been
quiet a long time (`claimed, last activity 3h ago`) is a visible smell for a human to judge — this
tool makes no liveness claim of its own; it only reports what the log itself says.

For **"what's the status on THIS goal"** — especially a large, multi-thread one (parallel slices,
several subagent dispatches) — run
`python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/log.py" goal .sdlc <goal>` and relay the full, oldest-first
history for that one goal, `[actor,thread]`-prefixed, with the distinct thread count in the header.

For **"what is in every slot right now"** — the several-goals-at-once view — run
`python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/log.py" slots .sdlc` and **relay its output verbatim**. It
renders the SAME active-goal derivation as **Block A** of `docs/output-contract.md`: one two-line
slot per active goal, newest activity first, capped at six with the remainder counted in the tail.
The block is constructed by `render.py`, not written freehand — do not reword it, re-order it, or
add a seventh slot.

Three things about that command are deliberate, and relaying them straight is the point:

- **It says when it does not know.** `action log off -- slot detail unavailable` means the config
  says the log is off and nothing has been read; `action log state unknown` means the config could
  not be read at all (a goal worktree has no `.sdlc/config.json`). Those are different facts from
  "on, and nothing is in flight". Never summarise any of them as "no goals are running".
- **A goal whose log records no SDLC phase is withheld, not guessed at.** The tail counts them.
- **No description ends in `→`** — the action log records what happened, never what unblocks next.

If a run reports no entries, the feature is very likely just **off** — point the user at config
`action_log.enabled: true` (default `false`, matching every other opt-in feature in this kit)
rather than treating it as an error. This skill needs no `gh`, no network access, and spends no LLM
tokens beyond relaying its own plain-text output.
