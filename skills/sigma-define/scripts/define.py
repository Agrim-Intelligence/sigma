"""OPEN a unit of work -- the half of the branching model that had no gesture (#1662, story #1427).

`features.py` reads a declaration. `feature_labels.py` acts on one at pick. `feature_stamp.py`
writes one onto an issue Sigma files itself. Every one of them presupposes that a unit ALREADY
EXISTS, and nothing in the kit creates one: `docs/branching-model.md` §14 documents opening a unit
as four commands a human types in a fixed order, from memory, spread across `git`, `gh`, `mkdir` and
an issue body. This module is that gesture.

IT ADDS THE FOLLOWING AND DELEGATES EVERYTHING ELSE. Intake, deduplication, planning, issue
creation, assignment and the run-now decision are `sigma-scope`'s, already shipped and already
tested; growing a second copy of them here would be the hardened-sibling divergence this repo's own
retrospectives keep flagging. What `sigma-scope` structurally cannot do is supply a UNIT -- §10 note
4 says so in as many words ("there is no calling goal to inherit from -- it is a human turning an
idea into a plan"). So:

    open_unit      the ordered gesture: branch, then label, then registry
    stamp_plan     the body marker, into every issue of a scope plan, BEFORE it is filed
    declare        the label, attached AFTER filing, and then VERIFIED through the real reader
    set_priority   THE answer to "prioritise this feature" -- one value recorded on the unit's OWN
                   registry entry, read by the comparator as a tie-break; never a write to a member
                   issue (#2266, epic #2260, slice 6)
    bump_priority  a DIFFERENT, still-legitimate gesture -- levelling a unit's members by hand,
                   applied to every open member's label, exactly (#2162). No longer what either
                   setup flow asks for by default; see `set_priority` above and #2266.
    priority_shorthand  `<name> <priority>`, two bare positional args, for a unit that already
                   exists -- calls `set_priority` UNCHANGED and returns its own report; refuses,
                   rather than guessing, when `name` is not yet a registered unit (#2331).

THE ORDER IS THE FEATURE, NOT AN IMPLEMENTATION DETAIL (§14). A body marker whose label does not yet
exist REFUSES the pick and sets the goal aside with `sdlc:needs-label` -- measured twice, and
measured on a repository with no registry at all, because `attach_at_pick` never looks at
`.sdlc/features/`. §14 states the order as a requirement rather than a suggestion for exactly that
reason. So `_STEPS` is a module constant, the executor is a loop over it, and A FAILING STEP STOPS
THE ONES AFTER IT. The last part is the one an implementation gets wrong by being helpful: running
all three and reporting the failures at the end leaves a label minted for a branch that does not
exist (and feature labels are never deleted, so there is no cleanup path), or a registry directory
created -- which arms the registry half for the WHOLE REPOSITORY, not just this unit -- on the
strength of a gesture that did not complete.

THIS IS THE ONE PLACE A `feature:*` LABEL MAY BE CREATED, AND IT SAYS SO RATHER THAN DOING IT
QUIETLY. The kit's standing rule is attach-never-create (§7): Sigma attaches an existing feature
label and never mints one, because a single typo in a body marker would mint junk that outlives the
unit. That rule is not weakened here and not touched anywhere else -- it is that `sigma-define` is the
HUMAN's own gesture, made once per unit, against a name this module has already validated, and a
model whose units can only be opened by hand is a model with half a life.

    IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT ROUTE THE CREATE THROUGH `sources.GitHubSource`, AND THAT IS A SAFETY
    DECISION RATHER THAN A CONVENIENCE. `GitHubSource._run` refuses a `gh label create` carrying a
    `feature:*` argument at the single chokepoint every `gh` call in that class passes through -- and
    it RETURNS `""`, which is the SUCCESS shape for a create. Routing this step through that class
    would therefore report a created label for a label that does not exist, and every issue this flow
    then filed would be refused at its own pick: §14's measured bug, reached from the opposite
    direction. So the label step uses this module's own injected runner, and
    `tests/test_define.py::test_the_label_create_is_exactly_the_shape_the_kit_refuses_everywhere_else`
    feeds this module's argv to the kit's own refusal predicate, so the exception cannot quietly
    stop describing the same call.

NOT A SECOND READER AND NOT A SECOND RULE. Every derived string comes from the module that owns it:
`features._is_unit_name` for what a unit may be called, `features.BRANCH_PREFIX` for the branch,
`feature_labels.label_for` for the label, `feature_stamp.stamp_body` for the marker (which already
composes it from `features`' own key constants AND feeds it back through `features.parse_body`
before returning it), `feature_registry.registry_dir` for the directory. Nothing here re-derives any
of them, and `tests/test_define.py` asserts the name predicate by OBJECT IDENTITY -- a behaviour
table is satisfied by a faithful copy, and a faithful copy is exactly what drifts when the original
is corrected.

WHY THE REGISTRY STEP IS HERE AT ALL, given that #1576 gates it. See `SKILL.md`'s own section: the
four adoption-blocking defects #1564 tracked are fixed, and #1638's residual is gone too -- every
derived key folds as of #1672 and #1673. What remains true is the reason this step exists at all: a
second casing of one unit needs TWO SPELLINGS to arise, which is precisely
what a define-time single source prevents. `open_unit` refuses a label whose casing differs from the
one asked for, and `declare` reports a case drift rather than reading it as agreement, so the two
doors that drift could enter by are both watched.

Module shape follows `feature_stamp.py` and `compile_plan.py`: siblings loaded by file path, pure
functions plus one fail-open stderr note, an injected `(cwd, argv) -> stdout` runner, and a CLI that
prints one JSON line per verb (`brainstorm.py`/`dedup.py`/`scope.py`/`assign.py resolve`'s own
convention).

    searching for it immediately afterwards returned `["enhancement"]` -- an unrelated label, and not
    the one just created. Seconds later the same query returned it. A plain `gh label list` found it
    on the first call, every time.

    """Attach `feature:<unit>` to each freshly-filed issue, then VERIFY through the real reader.

    THE LABEL IS ATTACHED AFTER CREATION, NEVER HANDED TO `gh issue create --label`. §10's asymmetry,
    inherited rather than re-argued: an absent label makes `gh issue create` fail the WHOLE create
    (label resolution precedes the create mutation), so the atomic-looking route loses the entire
    issue in exactly the case that has to survive. Attaching afterwards degrades to `body_only`, and
    `feature_labels.attach_at_pick` closes that the first time the issue is picked.

    THE NEVER-CREATE RULE HOLDS HERE BY CONSTRUCTION AND NOT BY PROMISE. `attach_label` resolves
    every name to a node id first and RAISES rather than minting one. This module's create lives at
    `open_unit`, before any issue exists, against a name it validated itself -- by the time we are
    here the bodies exist and may have been edited, and minting from edited text is precisely the
    typo-outlives-the-unit failure §7 refuses.

    VERIFICATION IS THE POINT OF THE FUNCTION, not a postscript. §4a is silent by design: a marker
    that lands somewhere `features.py` rule 5 refuses to read produces no error anywhere. So each
    issue is read BACK through `features.read` and its verdict recorded -- and `AmbiguousUnit` is
    caught PER ISSUE, which is the obligation that function's own docstring puts on every caller that
    sweeps: one hand-edited issue must cost one issue, never the whole flow.

    A CASE DRIFT IS REPORTED RATHER THAN READ AS AGREEMENT. `features.read` compares the two halves
    case-insensitively and returns the BODY's spelling, so a body saying `Voice` under a
    `feature:voice` label is a legitimate `agree`. It is still two casings of one unit -- one thing
    a person reads under two names, and the state every derived key had to be taught to fold away

    different `InvalidUnitName` class than this module's own copy, per `_load_loop_script`'s
    fresh-module-per-call contract; see `feature_sync.py`'s own note on why every catch here is
    `ValueError`, never the named subclass) is reported the same way, never thrown.

    unit's members by hand, on purpose, when that is actually wanted.

    UNCONDITIONAL, EXACT-MATCH, ALWAYS -- and DELIBERATELY NOT `GitHubSource._promote_blockers`'s
    own "highest wins, never downgrades" `min()` rule. Every remaining member's priority label is
    set to `priority` regardless of what it already carried, including downward, because a human
    invoked THIS routine directly, by name, to make the feature's members agree -- never as a side
    effect of setting the feature's own priority. `_promote_blockers`'s job starts only where this
    one stops: see the note below.

    NO BLOCKER-WALKING LOGIC OF ANY KIND. `GitHubSource._promote_blockers` (sources.py) already
    walks `blocked_by` edges transitively and cycle-safely on every `_sync_backlog` run once opted
    in (`discovery.blocker_promotion.mode`, already `"smart"` on this repo), and this routine's own
    member-priority writes are exactly the upstream change that mechanism watches for on its next
    run. Building a second blocker-walk here would be the "second, parallel write path"
    `_write_priority_label`'s own docstring forbids -- so this function enumerates and writes ONLY
    the feature's direct, open, labelled members: nothing a member itself blocks or is blocked by.

    THE WRITE GOES THROUGH `source._write_priority_label` -- sources.py's OWN docstring names it
    "the one place an issue's priority label is ever written" -- so there is exactly one `gh`-call
    path into a priority label whether `_promote_blockers` or this routine triggered it.

    `source` is duck-typed on `_REQUIRED_PRIORITY_METHODS` plus `repo`/`proposed_label`/
    `priority_prefix`/`priority_aliases` -- the real surface `sources.GitHubSource` already
    exposes. A `LocalSource` (frontmatter-only priority, no priority LABEL at all) has none of
    these and is refused up front, with a stated reason, rather than half-applied."""
