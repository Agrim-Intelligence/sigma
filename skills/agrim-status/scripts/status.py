    github-backed loop reports '0 parked' while N issues sit parked. Scoped to the same assignee the
    loop discovers by, so it shows YOUR queue. Fail-open: an unreachable gh yields zeros, never raises.

    Label bookkeeping is asymmetric and matters here: a claimed goal gets `sdlc:in-progress` (KEEPING
    `sdlc:goal`); parking/failing it adds `sdlc:parked` and drops `sdlc:goal` but LEAVES
    `sdlc:in-progress` behind. So a parked issue still carries the in-progress label. Counting bare
    `sdlc:in-progress` would therefore count parked issues as active (and floor `pending` to 0). Active
    in-progress is the intersection `sdlc:goal AND sdlc:in-progress` (gh ANDs repeated `--label`); a
    parked issue, having lost `sdlc:goal`, is excluded and counted only under `sdlc:parked`.
    pending = open `sdlc:goal` minus those active-in-progress. done/failed don't map to a single
    open-issue label in github mode, so they stay 0.

    #233: `proposed` DOES map now. A retro/hand-off follow-up filed with immediately_actionable=False
    carries the distinct, config-overridable label `handoff.proposed_label(config)` (#1348 renamed
    the shipped default to `sdlc:needs-confirmation`; a repo can still override it back) and
    withholds `sdlc:goal`, so it is filed-but-never-auto-picked. Nothing surfaced that set before, so
    it grew unnoticed six times in one run (#224–#232). Counting it MINUS those a human has since
    promoted (by adding `sdlc:goal`) is the exact mirror of the pending computation above: a promoted
    proposal is already counted under pending/in_progress, so it must not double-count here, and a
    closed one drops out via `--state open`. Assignee-scoped like every other count — YOUR queue.

    `config` (#1348): threaded through so the counted label matches whatever this repo's OWN
    `handoff.proposed_label(config)` actually resolves to, rather than a hardcoded literal that
    could silently drift from what `handoff.py` really applies. `None` (a caller that hasn't been
    updated, or a context with no full config handy) falls back to the shipped default name.

    #1833: every `n(*labels)` call below is now the shared `fetch_issues_rest` REST fetch
    (`sources.py`, cross-loaded by `_load_sources` above) instead of `gh issue list --label ...`
    -- confirmed graphql-search-billed regardless of `--search`, the same defect #1829 fixed on
    the loop's own pick path. `assignee` is resolved to a real login ONCE, up front, and reused
    across every count: the OLD `--assignee @me` shape cost nothing extra (GitHub's search backend
    resolves the `@me` alias server-side), but REST's `assignee=` query param has no such alias
    (a hard 422, confirmed live by #1829's own research) -- resolving it once here, like
