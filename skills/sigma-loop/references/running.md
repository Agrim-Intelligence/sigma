# Running one goal

## Context-efficient inspection

Locate before opening: use `rg --files` for paths and `rg -n` for symbols or claims.
Read only the relevant lines with a bounded range; expand outward only when the
boundary is unclear. Do not dump whole files or broad search output into context.
For bulky tests or diagnostics, save full output to a scratch file, then inspect
its exit status and focused matches or a bounded tail. Do not hide failures, and
keep secrets out of the scratch file. This is guidance, not a measured savings claim.

The detail behind step 3 of [`../SKILL.md`](../SKILL.md): resolving the model tier, running
each phase as its own subagent, the maker-is-never-the-checker rule, the no-phase-commits
rule, matching ceremony to the lane, cutting the worktree (3a) and running slice waves (3b).

---

Then **recall prior art** — if the knowledge graph is enabled, run the `sigma-context`
pre-flight to pull a cited brief from the graph + past issues + conventions, so the goal starts
informed by history instead of a flushed window (no-op when the KG is off).
**Match the model to the goal.** **The goal-level `model_choice` ledger event is now written
automatically, in code, at pick time (#1627)** — `loop.py`'s own `_next()` (the one chokepoint
every picker already passes through) reads the goal's real title+body and calls `predict.py why`
+ records the result itself, with no agent involvement. **Read the tier IT resolved from the
pick's own stderr** — a line shaped `sigma: model tier for <goal> resolved to <tier>
(signal=<signal>)` — rather than recomputing it yourself, **especially in github mode**: `"$goal"`
there is the bare issue number, and a manual `predict.py resolve "$goal" .sdlc` classifies that
literal digit string, not the issue's real text, landing the unsignalled `sonnet` default no
matter what the goal actually says. That is the exact bug #1627 fixed for the automatic call;
recomputing by hand reintroduces it. In LOCAL mode `"$goal"` genuinely is the goal's own file
path, so `predict.py resolve "$goal" .sdlc` there still resolves correctly — but reading the
already-printed stderr line works in EITHER mode and needs no branching. If the stderr line is
missing (`model_selection` isn't `"auto"`, or the pick predates this line reaching stdout in your
log), fall back to running `resolve` yourself: in local mode `resolve "$goal" .sdlc` as before; in
github mode, fetch the issue's real text FIRST, title on the first line
(`gh issue view "$goal" --json title,body --jq '.title + "\n\n" + (.body // "")'`, POSIX
shell — a haiku signal counts only in the title, #2827) and pass that text as the argument, never
the bare `"$goal"`. Whatever tier you end up with
(`haiku`/`sonnet`/`opus`/`fable`) is the GOAL's ceiling; `signal` (from either the stderr line or
your own fallback `why`/`resolve` call) is the literal text the regex matched (`migrat`, `secur`)
— WHY it's that tier, which no reader can check without it (#880). You do not need to separately
record the goal-level LEDGER choice — that already happened. **You DO still need to log this same
tier+signal to the LOCAL action-log copy yourself** (a different destination this issue did not
automate — `.sdlc/state/log/`, not the ledger): `python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/loop.py" log
.sdlc "$goal" model_choice --model <tier> --signal <signal>`. **Use the SAME tier+signal you just
established above — never a fresh, separate `why "$goal"` call here**: in github mode that bare
`"$goal"` is exactly the wrong input this whole paragraph exists to steer you away from, and
logging a second, differently-computed value here would silently contradict the one just
recorded. A defaulted tier matches nothing and correctly carries no signal — pass it empty or
omit it. **Per-step `resolve-step` below is UNCHANGED** — it stays prose-invoked, since a plan
step's free text has no structured, goal-agnostic artifact code could read on its own.
**`agent_dispatch --role phase/goal-slot/slice` below stays prose-invoked too — the same shape as
resolve-step just above, for a different reason, and NOT the same consequence.** Whether a phase
actually ran as its own dispatched Task-tool subagent, or inline in the orchestrating session, is a
fact that lives on the **agent host's** side (Claude Code's own Task-tool dispatch decision) —
unlike `model_choice` (#1627), where `predict.py`'s own `resolve()`/`resolve_step()` already hold
the goal's tier in-process and can shell out to record it themselves, no code in this repo is ever
inside the call that decides dispatch-vs-inline, on any host: there is no chokepoint to hook.
**The consequence is not the same as resolve-step's, though**: a plan step resolved to the wrong
model tier is a bounded cost/quality miss, self-correcting next time a human reads it. A phase that
silently regresses from dispatched to inline breaks, with zero signal, the maker≠checker discipline
— see the maker≠checker rule below, the reason per-phase subagents exist at all. Accepted here as a
documented, permanent boundary, not built into code; detecting (never enforcing) the gap after the
fact is tracked separately in #1779.

**This paragraph is about whether the DISPATCH CALL ITSELF is code-driven or prose-invoked — a
separate axis from whether a TIER is available at dispatch time.** Goal-slot no longer lacks one:
`references/picking.md` step 1a has the orchestrator capture it from the same pick that returned
the goal, exactly like this paragraph's own phase-dispatch tier a few lines below. Being grouped
with resolve-step here is only about the first axis; on the second, goal-slot now matches
phase/slice, not resolve-step.
Then run **each phase as its own subagent** with that host's model override. Claude's Task tool
accepts the ledger tier directly: pass that exact Task `model` selector to
`phase_report.py start --requested-model <selector>` too, so the step banner can name what was
requested. **Also pass the Task tool's own reasoning-effort parameter, mapped from the same
tier** — low for `haiku`, medium for `sonnet`, high for `opus`, medium or high for `fable`
(creative work) — the same mapping Codex uses below, just applied to Claude's separate `effort`
argument instead of a model substitution. The tier alone is not enough: without this, the phase
subagent inherits whatever effort the host defaults to rather than the one the goal earned, and
that default runs hot. On Codex, resolve the known goal tier before every phase dispatch:
`python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../sigma-model/scripts/predict.py" host-model codex "<tier-or-off>" .sdlc`.
It prints `model=<id> effort=<effort>`; pass those exact values as the Codex subagent's `model`
and reasoning-effort arguments. Never pass an Anthropic tier string as a Codex model ID. The
resolver refuses an unknown or malformed mapping; choose an approved Codex ID in
`model_host_overrides.codex`, or update the plugin when the catalog changes, instead of guessing.
Pass that returned ID to
`phase_report.py start --host-model <id>` as well; `end` checks every observed turn and refuses a
mismatch. On Codex, set `fork_turns="none"` for every phase and
pass the goal, phase, worktree and relevant artifact paths in the prompt; the default copies the
maker's conversation into the child. Bracket each phase-subagent dispatch itself:
`python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/loop.py" log .sdlc "$goal" agent_dispatch --role phase --phase
<phase> --model <tier>` right after dispatching it, `agent_done --role phase --phase <phase>
--result <...>` right when it returns. **`--model <tier>` is now REQUIRED on this call (#2514) —
`loop.py log` refuses a `--role phase` dispatch with no `--model`.** `<tier>` here is the SAME
value you already read from `model_choice` above, never a fresh resolve at this call site — the
tier is already known by the time you dispatch. One subagent PER PHASE, not one for the whole goal: that is
what keeps a reviewer phase a **sibling** of the maker phase it checks (fresh context, no nesting),
never a continuation of it — see the maker≠checker rule below. Artifacts pass between phases through
the filesystem (`.sdlc/plans/`, the worktree diff, the issue timeline), not shared context. If it
is supported by the host, keep static skill instructions and tool definitions ahead of the varying
goal/phase details so prompt caches can reuse the stable prefix; Sigma does not control the
host's cache settings. Do not paste whole prior phase transcripts into a child prompt. Have each
phase return its verdict, changed artifact paths and any unresolved risk; keep full evidence in
durable artifacts that the next phase can inspect. Preserve each plan step's verification and the
fresh full proof required in the completion turn. `loop.py verify` remains mandatory and must run
the configured command; a prior manual test run never replaces it. Avoid duplicate manual
full-suite invocations when the source and proving command have not changed; repeat when code
changes or a concrete flaky failure leaves the result uncertain. This keeps independent review
and required gates intact while avoiding duplicate
model turns and full-suite reruns.
If model selection prints `off` (the default), pass `off` to the Codex resolver. It selects the
versioned ordinary-work mapping (`sonnet` → Terra), never the current parent-session model.
**Per-STEP downgrade:** once the plan exists, resolve each plan
step too — `python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../sigma-model/scripts/predict.py" resolve-step "<step
text>" .sdlc "$goal"` prints `model=<tier> effort=<low|medium|high>` (the trailing `"$goal"` is
new, #1030 -- resolve-step's own step text can never double as a goal identifier the way a
goal-level call's text can, so this is the one call in this skill that needs it spelled out
explicitly; resolve-step now also records the choice internally, see sigma-model's own SKILL.md)
— log its portable tier and effort too (`python3
"${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/loop.py" log .sdlc "$goal" model_choice --model <tier> --effort <effort>
--phase <phase>`) — and run a MECHANICAL step (run the
tests, a watcher/poll, lint) in a subagent at ITS cheaper tier/effort instead of the goal
ceiling. Before a Codex step dispatch, resolve the `resolve-step` result's `<tier>` with
`python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../sigma-model/scripts/predict.py" host-model codex "<tier-or-off>" .sdlc` and
pass its returned model ID and effort to Codex. On other hosts, pass the tier and, where supported,
the resolve-step effort. For that step's `phase_report.py step` banner, pass the exact dispatched
model ID with `--host-model <id>` instead of the ordinary `--phase-model`, as well as its portable
`--model <tier>`; otherwise the banner honestly reports the host model as unrecorded.
Never run a step ABOVE the goal ceiling — except the tier a `loop.py escalate` answer names
(below), which becomes the new ceiling. Then read the goal and
run it through the full SDLC (goal → research → plan → plan-review →
implement → review) — each phase via its **executor** (the `superpowers`/`code-review` companion on
Claude if installed, else Sigma's portable `sigma-brainstorm`/`sigma-research`/`sigma-plan`/
`sigma-implement`/`sigma-review`/`sigma-verify`; each skill's resolution header picks). `$goal` is a **file path** in local mode (read the file) or a **GitHub issue
number** in github mode (`gh issue view "$goal"` to read it).

**P1 GOAL records acceptance before Research or code.** Run
`python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/acceptance.py" record .sdlc "$goal"`.
It captures 3–7 checkable statements from `## Done when`. If the section is absent,
draft a file with that section and repeat with `--draft <file>`; the command posts drafted
GitHub criteria as an issue comment before writing the record. Optionally supply
`--verify-command '<command>'` (local frontmatter is inherited). Never put secrets in it.
A refusal stops P1 until the source/draft is repaired. Keep the resulting
`.sdlc/acceptance/<goal-stem>.md` unchanged; copy it into the goal worktree and commit it
with plan/research. This step applies regardless of companion or portable executor.

**The maker must not be the checker (`config.review.independent`, default on).**
Every review gate — plan-review, the pre-PR code review, the post-PR review at step 6 — is asked to
run as a **fresh subagent that never saw the maker's context**. Dispatching it and waiting on it is the same blocking
dependency `loop.py verify`/`work.py merge` are — see the REQUIRED PATTERN at step 6, which covers
this dispatch too: your very next action depends on its verdict, so dispatch it foreground/
blocking rather than inventing a separate "wait" step. Give it the PROJECT, not the author:
`python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/review_context.py" brief .sdlc "$goal" --for
plan-review|code-review|pr-review [--artifact <path|PR#>] > "/tmp/brief-$(basename "$goal" .md).md"`
assembles the pack into that file (`basename`: `$goal` is a path in local mode) — north-star +
conventions + contracts + the goal + a pointer to the artifact — and you hand the subagent **only
that**. So it re-derives blast radius from the whole repo and can *disagree*, instead of
rubber-stamping the plan/diff it just wrote (a lower-tier maker does). A diff-only reviewer cannot see what a small change breaks two files
away; the brief's whole-repo grounding is the point. Where the host has no subagents this is **not**
a degradation — run `python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/reviewer.py" resolve .sdlc` and use the
mechanism it names (a fresh `process`, or the operator's `command`); every host asks for an
author-blind reviewer by its own route. Only a machine where the resolver returns `inline` reviews
inline, and that verdict must say so. With
`review.independent: false` reviews run inline as before (the maker reviews its own work — only for a
trivial solo repo).

**Record the plan-review verdict before Implement** (`gates.plan_review`). The dispatching site —
never the dispatched reviewer — records it from the main checkout (3a), before anything edits the
plan, against the brief file the dispatch gesture above wrote. It only READS that file; never
rebuild the brief here, because a rebuild hashes the edited plan and the check could never fail:

```
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/work.py" record-plan-review .sdlc "$goal" --verdict <VERDICT> \
  --plan-sha256 "$(awk '/^Plan sha256: /{print $3; exit}' "/tmp/brief-$(basename "$goal" .md).md")"
```

`<VERDICT>` is the reviewer's SOUND, SOUND-WITH-REFINEMENTS or FIX-FIRST; a FIX-FIRST is recorded
too. This is the one writer of the verdict and the one emitter of its `plan_review` journal gate
(never also `loop.py emit` one). It refuses a sha the plan no longer holds, so record a
SOUND-WITH-REFINEMENTS as returned, before applying any refinement to the plan file. Copy the plan
to the branch unchanged; after any edit of either copy, re-review and re-record. With
`gates.plan_review.enabled`, `work.py pr` refuses to push unless an approving verdict is recorded
for the exact bytes of the plan on the branch (`landing.md`).

**A PR review posts only generation-bound evidence.** For `pr-review`, create the generation with
`python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/review_context.py" brief .sdlc "$goal" --for pr-review
--artifact "PR#$pr" --output ".sdlc/state/review-manifests/$goal.json"`, then load its immutable
paths using `source <(python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/work.py" review-paths .sdlc "$goal"
--manifest ".sdlc/state/review-manifests/$goal.json" --format sh)`. Run `python3
"${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/reviewer.py" resolve .sdlc > "$REVIEW_RESOLUTION"`. For a resolved
`process` or `command`, run `python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/work.py" run-resolved-review .sdlc
"$goal" --manifest "$REVIEW_MANIFEST" --resolution "$REVIEW_RESOLUTION"`. For a resolved
`subagent`, hand only `$REVIEW_BRIEF` to a fresh host subagent, then run `python3
"${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/work.py" record-subagent-review .sdlc "$goal" --manifest
"$REVIEW_MANIFEST" --resolution "$REVIEW_RESOLUTION" --verdict approve|block|unblock --reason
"<reviewer result>"`. Then run `python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/work.py" review-evidence .sdlc "$goal" --manifest
"$REVIEW_MANIFEST" --review-result "$REVIEW_RESULT"`. Only then post `work.py post-review .sdlc
"$goal" --evidence "$REVIEW_EVIDENCE" --verdict approve`, or the same evidence argument with
`--verdict block --reason "<the issues>"`. To clear a prior loop block on the same revision, publish
a fresh generation (every publication is new), have its reviewer return `unblock`, and post that
evidence with `--verdict unblock`; a block's own evidence cannot be reused. The CLI and writer
boundary reject a post-review call without that evidence. An `inline` route passes its verdict
explicitly to `run-resolved-review` with `--verdict` and `--reason`. An ambiguous post is recovered
with `work.py reconcile-review-post .sdlc "$goal" --evidence "$REVIEW_EVIDENCE"`, never by posting
again. See `landing.md` for all three.

**A block redispatches the fix to a fresh subagent — never resume the one that got blocked, or
the one that blocked it.** This specializes "one subagent PER PHASE" above to the fix→re-review
cycle any review gate (plan-review, pre-PR/code-review, post-PR/pr-review) or a failing `loop.py
verify` can start: the fix is still the SAME phase for `phase_report.py`/`loop.py log
agent_dispatch --role phase` purposes (a fix after a blocked post-PR review is still `phase:
implement`; a fix after a blocked plan-review is still `phase: plan`) — never a new phase name —
but it runs exactly like that phase's first attempt: fresh context, sibling not continuation,
never resume the blocked subagent's own conversation. Hand the fix subagent only the minimum it
needs: the reviewer's (or verify's) own blocking findings, the plan path
(`.sdlc/plans/<goal-stem>.md`), and the worktree path — never the maker's prior transcript, which
a fresh subagent by construction does not have anyway. The re-review that follows is equally
fresh — never the same reviewer subagent asked to look again — and is handed only its own prior
verdict (the block reason just posted or recorded) plus a live pointer to what changed since:
for `plan-review`/`code-review`, re-run the dispatch gesture above for that gate, redirect included
(a fresh `/tmp/brief-<stem>.md` pointing at the current plan file or worktree diff, and the brief a
re-reviewed plan's verdict is recorded against); for `pr-review`, publish a fresh `--output`
generation, whose brief already resolves to the live `gh pr diff <PR#>` — never the earlier
review's transcript pasted in by hand. Step 6's worked example (the
post-PR cycle) carries a code-enforced cap (`work.max_review_cycles`); plan-review and
pre-PR/code-review have no equivalent counter.

**A send-back the tier cannot converge escalates the tier; it never parks on "budget" (#2828).**
Token budget and tier size are not park reasons: neither is a human decision. The trigger is
mechanical, not a judgment the struggling tier makes about itself: run the verb **before any park
or fail after a review send-back, and at the latest on the second send-back at the same tier**:
`python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/loop.py" escalate .sdlc "$goal" <tier> --after plan-review`
(`--after code-review` or `--after pr-review` for those gates; `--after` is required). Read the
first word of its stdout:

- `ESCALATE <next> effort=<e>` (exit 0) — re-dispatch the SAME phase fresh at `<next>` (haiku →
  sonnet → opus) and effort `<e>`, with the reviewer's findings, the plan path and the worktree
  path, exactly like any fix above. The verb has already recorded `model_choice` with the signal
  `escalated: <gate> send-back at <T>` in the action log when that is on (it ships on from
  `/sigma-init`) and in the journal when that is on (it ships off); pass `<next>` to
  `phase_report.py start --model` and `agent_dispatch --role phase --model`. `<next>` is this goal's
  ceiling from here on, for every later phase too — the router under-estimated the goal. Before
  each later phase dispatch (and on any resume), take the higher of the pick-time tier and
  `python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/loop.py" escalate .sdlc "$goal" --show` (prints the
  escalated tier clamped to the current `model_selection_max_tier`, or `none`). The verb itself also reads that floor back, so passing the pick-time
  tier again still climbs rather than repeating a rung.
- `CEILING <T>` (exit 3) — no tier above `<T>` within `model_selection_max_tier` (`fable` is never
  an escalation target). Keep the existing fix → re-review cycle at `<T>`; only a fix that still
  does not resolve after a couple of rounds is "a failure you cannot resolve" (above) — park or
  fail it rather than cycling indefinitely.
- `OFF` (exit 3) — `model_selection` is not `"auto"`, so no tier is routed and there is none to
  raise (Claude phases inherit the session model; Codex maps `off` to its ordinary-work model, as
  above); the same fix → re-review cycle, then the same rule, applies.

The ladder has two rungs, so a goal escalates at most twice: the floor lives in
`.sdlc/state/escalation/<goal>.json`, control state written whatever the ledger, journal and
action-log settings are. A `model_host_overrides.codex` entry the resolver refuses (checked before
anything is written, as `resolve` does) makes the verb exit 2 with nothing recorded: fix it, re-run. On the
post-PR cycle `work.max_review_cycles` still parks at its cap whatever the tier. **Per host:**
Claude passes `<next>` as the Task tool's `model` (and `<e>` as its effort); Codex maps it with
`host-model codex` as described above and uses that resolver's effort, not `<e>`. A host with no per-subagent model override (Cursor)
cannot re-dispatch at another tier: the verb still decides and records, and the operator switches
the session model, or the goal is handled as at `CEILING`. The escalation is a real decision there; the re-dispatch is not enforceable. **On
Codex, a redispatched fix or re-review also sets `fork_turns="none"`** — the default copies the
parent's own conversation into the child, which is exactly the large, stale context this rule
exists to avoid — and passes the goal, phase, worktree and the artifact paths above in the prompt
instead.

**No phase subagent commits — only `work.py commit` does, once, at step 6.** This binds every
dispatched phase subagent (research, plan, plan-review, implement, review, retro, and each
individual slice under 3b), not only Implement, and it does not travel from one dispatch prompt
to the next on its own: **say it in each one**, the same way the brief above is handed to every
reviewer. The reason is `commit()`'s own short-circuit: it stages with `git add -A`, reads back
`git diff --cached --name-only`, and returns `"nothing to commit"` the instant that is empty —
BEFORE `_secret_refusal` (the credential scan) ever runs. A commit any phase made earlier in the
SAME worktree, by any means outside `work.py`, has already emptied that staged diff by the time
step 6 calls `commit()`: `git add -A` finds nothing new to stage, the scan never inspects what
that commit contains, and a credential inside it reaches the PR exactly as if the guard did not
exist. This shipped once already (#1756): telling only the Implement dispatch prompt left Review
and Retro free to run a bare `git commit` in the same worktree, and one of them did — caught safe
only because a human happened to re-check the diff by hand, not because anything here stopped it.
A phase that wants a local checkpoint leaves the worktree DIRTY and says so in its own handoff; it
never stages or commits anything itself.

**Match the ceremony to the goal** — after Research, resolve the lane it measured. In **local mode**
run `python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/discovery.py" lane "$goal"`; in **github mode** the goal is
an issue number with no frontmatter, so read the lane from Research's phase note on the issue
timeline you already fetched. Either way an unsized goal is **`medium`** — unknown gets more rigour,
not less. On **small**, plan in a few lines and keep the retro to one; on **large**, work the design
out before planning and consider splitting it into several goals. **Plan-Review runs in full at every lane** — small goals are exactly
where an unreviewed plan ships, because nobody looks twice at an obvious-seeming change.
The lane is a *starting* call: if implementation shows the goal is bigger, escalate and say so in the
phase note. **Park instead of forcing through**
if you hit any of:
- a hard checkpoint / a decision only the user can make,
- an **irreversible or expensive action** (deploy, delete, overwrite, spend, migrate) — NEVER
  run one unattended,
- a failure you cannot resolve — record THIS one as `failed` (see step 6): parked means
  "needs a human decision", failed means "needs a fix"; the queue separates the two.

**3a. Register you're driving this goal, THEN cut the worktree if enabled.** Regardless of
`config.work.enabled`, first register that you're the one driving this goal right now:
`python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/loop.py" agent-start .sdlc "$goal" --pid $PPID` — `$PPID` is
YOUR OWN stable process id, captured once (same contract `--session-pid` already documents), not
any individual command's own. **A nonzero exit on ANY host means task ownership was not
established: stop this goal before `work.py start`; another live task may own its worktree** --
before #2527 this could only happen on Codex (a mismatched thread id); it is now also the correct
reaction on Claude, where a live, different pid already registered for this (goal, thread) refuses
the same way. This local
marker file is what a second session's picker cross-checks before treating your claim as an
abandoned one (#1197): a picker's own process always exits within moments of making a pick, long
before your real work here starts, so nesting this call behind `work.enabled` would leave a
fresh `/sigma-init` install (where `work.enabled` ships `null` -- not yet decided, #2255 -- and
reads as off either way until `/sigma-setup` or a human turns it on) with no way to tell a
live worker from a dead one. `agent_watch.enabled` (also off by default) gates a SEPARATE,
genuinely opt-in dead-agent NOTIFY tick only — never this write.
With `config.work.enabled` on: `python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/work.py" start .sdlc
"$goal" --session-pid "$PPID"`. **Pass `--session-pid "$PPID"` — the same value you just gave
`agent-start --pid`, and the same one every `loop.py` call takes.** It is how `work.py` knows the
live agent marker it is about to read is YOURS: this command runs as a short-lived child process,
so without being told it reads your own registration as a second session in your worktree,
refuses the resume, and silently skips the feature-branch rebase upkeep on every pick (#1687).
It cuts a fresh worktree and branch from `<remote>/<base>` — which **is** the goal-start
rebase: nothing to replay, so it cannot conflict or strand a half-applied tree in an unattended
run. `<base>` is resolved **per goal**, for **GitHub-backed goals only** (github discovery, and
a goal whose id is an issue number): the unit the issue declares (`feature/<name>`, from a
`feature:<name>` label or a `Feature:` body marker), else `work.base`, else the branch the loop
was started on. In local-goals mode nothing is read and `work.base` is always the answer. Read
the line it prints — it names the base it actually cut from. **If that line says the declaration
could not be read**, the base is a fallback, not an answer (`base_resolved: false` in the work
record): check `gh auth status` first, and if this project uses `feature:` units, park the goal
rather than opening a PR against a base nobody resolved. If it uses none, the configured base
was the right answer anyway.
**If this command exits 4, STOP this goal and do NOT `record` it** (#2009). Exit 4 means it was
resuming an existing worktree, found it behind its base, and could not bring it forward — so
every phase after this one would read stale code, which is what makes a resumed goal produce a
wrong research dossier and a wrong plan. It has already moved the goal out of the claimed state
for you: a genuine conflict is **parked** (a person has to resolve it), and a transient failure
**releases the claim** so the next pick simply retries — a second consecutive transient parks
instead, so an outage reaches a human rather than spinning. Recording anything on top of that
would undo a transition that is already correct. Every other exit code is unchanged, and the
other `REFUSED — …` lines this command can print are still exit 0.
Do **every edit for this goal inside that worktree**; the human's checkout must never move,
and never change branch (it would rewrite `.sdlc/goals/` underneath you). Bookkeeping is the
exception and stays in the MAIN checkout — keep passing `loop.py`/`ledger.py` the same `.sdlc`
path as always, never the worktree's stale copy of it. `loop.py verify` finds the worktree by
itself. Feature off → work in the checkout exactly as before (the agent-start registration above
still runs either way).

**3b. Independent slices? Run the wave — don't queue it.** Once the plan exists, if it declared
slices in `.sdlc/plans/<goal-stem>.slices.json`, compute the dispatch plan:
`python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/slices.py" plan .sdlc "$goal"` (on Codex add `--host codex
--goal-worktree <absolute-path> --tier <tier-or-off>` using the goal worktree from `work.py start`). Before every Codex
slice dispatch, resolve its goal or downgraded-step tier with `python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../sigma-model/scripts/predict.py" host-model codex "<tier-or-off>" .sdlc` and pass the returned model ID and effort to the subagent. Also give `slices.py plan` that source tier as
`--tier <tier-or-off>`: it resolves the mapping itself before printing a `dispatch: session` command, so a raw or stale model ID cannot enter its fresh interactive Codex process.
planning when `work.enabled` is off; run that goal as one unit. Without a goal worktree and readable
manifest, the Codex session line refuses to give a runnable command.
It groups the runnable slices
into **waves** — each wave mutually non-conflicting by declared files, capped at
`parallel.max_concurrent`. Do ONE wave at a time: dispatch each slice as a **subagent** (fresh
context). The plan's `isolation: worktree` is a requirement, not proof the host provided it. If
Codex's subagent tool shares the checkout, run those slices sequentially; concurrent work
requires a distinct worktree for each slice and a verified landing path. For each dispatched slice:
log the dispatch
(`python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/loop.py" log .sdlc "$goal" agent_dispatch --thread
<slice-id> --role slice --phase implement --model <tier>`) and register it for the death-watch the same way 3a
does, one level down (`python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/loop.py" agent-start .sdlc "$goal"
--pid $PPID --thread <slice-id>` — giving intra-goal slice parallelism its own
independently-tracked pid per thread). **`--model <tier>` is now REQUIRED on this dispatch too
(#2514) — `loop.py log` refuses a `--role slice` dispatch with no `--model`.** `<tier>` here is the
GOAL's own ceiling tier (the same `model_choice` value resolved at the top of this doc) unless
this specific slice's plan step was itself downgraded via `resolve-step`, in which case pass that
resolved tier instead. Land the wave — logging each landed slice first (`agent_done
--thread <slice-id> --role slice --result <...>`) — then re-run `plan` for the next. **Never**
dispatch a slice with an unattended `claude -p` or `codex exec` — a second worker on one `.sdlc`
breaks every state file here. A slice marked `dispatch: session` will not fit one subagent's
context: **print the plan's interactive Claude or Codex command and let the human start it** —
never start it yourself. No manifest, or `parallel.enabled` off → run the goal as one unit,
exactly as before.
