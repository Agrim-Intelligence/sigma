"""Team coordination ledger: an append-only record of what the loop actually did.

WHY PER-AUTHOR-PROCESS FILES. Every writing PROCESS owns exactly one file
(`ledger/entries/<actor>-<host>.<pid>.jsonl`) and never touches anyone else's, so two people
running the loop against one repo cannot conflict on a write — the "team view" is the UNION of
those files, computed on read. The obvious alternative (one shared file everyone appends to)
needs a lock this kit does not have, and git would turn every concurrent append into a merge
conflict. The instance token, not just the actor, is load-bearing: the actor resolves to the
authenticated `gh` login, and several parallel loops can share one login (F10) — without the
pid, two such loops would collide on the SAME file and could mint the same `id`; without the
host hash (#540), so would two MACHINES authenticating as one bot account.

THE COUNT IS NOT A LEAK. One file per writing process means MANY files per actor: every run
adds one, `read_all()` unions them, and nothing here ever compacts them. Hundreds of files for
a single actor is the designed steady state — an external audit of one adopter machine found
175 for one actor after two and a half weeks — so a reader who expects a single file per actor
will mistake a healthy directory for a fault. Nothing is ever read back by filename: `read_all()`
globs every `*.jsonl` under the stream directory and attributes each line by the `actor` FIELD
inside it, so the file count costs correctness nothing.

WHAT IT IS FOR. The review queue answers "what stopped?" for one person on one machine
(and it is gitignored, so nobody else ever sees it). The ledger answers "what has the team
done, and what is waiting on whom?" — it is committed, it carries a timestamp and an actor
on every line, and a hand-off entry names the person who has to act.

Default OFF: with no `ledger` block in config.json every entry point is a no-op, so a repo
that has not opted in behaves exactly as it did before this module existed. Zero deps.

#: Optional fields, all free-form except `state` (validated) — additive by design: an older
#: reader ignores a field it does not know rather than failing. `pr` carries a pull-request number.
#: `reclaimed_actor` (PR #1235 review, Finding 1/3) is written ONLY by a `release` entry that an
#: AUTOMATED sweep (`loop.py`'s `_auto_reclaim_stale_claims`) writes on behalf of a claim's
#: ORIGINAL holder, who is not the process performing the write — see `_held()`'s own docstring
#: for why the terminal-entry `actor` field alone (always self-attributed to the writing process,
#: never forged) cannot carry this. Sourced only from the ledger's OWN prior `claimed` entry (via
#: `expired_claims()`'s returned actor), never from arbitrary/external input — an already-`
#: _safe_name()`-bounded short id, same trust level as `area`/`to`/`issue`, so it gets no
#: free-text scrub (see `append()`'s field-by-field treatment below).
#:
#: `run_id` (#1121, follow-up from #841's own review): this run/process-tree's identity, sourced
#: by every writer from `state.run_identity()` (`SIGMA_RUN_ID`, #498's existing per-worker-tree
#: id — see that function's own docstring for why an env var, not anything filesystem-shared, is
#: the one axis that tells two CONCURRENT processes of the SAME actor apart). `_held()` uses this
#: to scope its stale-terminal-entry guard by (actor, run_id) rather than actor alone — see that
#: function's own docstring for the exact race this closes. Unlike `reclaimed_actor`/`area`/`to`/
#: `issue`, this is NOT always sourced from our own code: `state.run_identity()`'s own docstring
#: notes `supervise_daemon.py` "respects an id set by an outer launcher", so like `ref` (#385) it gets the
#: `_sanitize_free_text(..., cap=BOUNDED_ID_CAP)` treatment in `append()` below, not the raw-write
#: path the fully-internal enum/id fields get.
#:
#: `reclaimed_run` (PR #1269 review, blocking finding 1): the SAME "name the target explicitly"
#: pattern `reclaimed_actor` already uses, one level finer -- the ORIGINAL claim's own `run_id`,
#: never the release entry's own (that stays `run_id` above, always self-attributed to the
#: writer). Closes the gap `reclaimed_actor` alone left open: the auto-reclaim sweep's own
#: release could still wipe a live re-claim by the SAME actor's OWN second, concurrent process,
#: because actor-only scoping cannot tell two same-actor processes apart. Sourced only from the
#: ledger's own prior `claimed` entry (via `expired_claim_run_ids()`'s returned run_id, mirroring
#: `reclaimed_actor`'s own `expired_claims()` sourcing), same trust tier as `reclaimed_actor` --
#: no free-text scrub needed, see `append()`'s field-by-field treatment below.
#:
#: `autowatch_hop` (#1319, skills/sigma-loop/scripts/autowatch.py): how many autowatch-triggered
#: `/sigma-loop` runs already precede this entry in an unattended wake-and-work chain -- the field
#: `ledger.autowatch.hop_limit` is checked against. Like `run_id`, it is sourced from OUTSIDE this
#: plugin's own code (an outer launcher's environment -- here `SIGMA_AUTOWATCH_HOP`, which
#: autowatch.py sets on the driven subprocess's environment before launching it, exactly mirroring
#: `state.run_identity()`'s own `SIGMA_RUN_ID` precedent), not a hard-coded constant any one
#: call site controls -- see `append()`'s own env-default-fill below for why every entries-stream
#: write inside that process tree inherits it automatically, with no other call site (handoff.py,
#: loop.py, ...) needing to know autowatch exists at all. Same trust tier as `run_id`/`ref` --
#: `_sanitize_free_text(..., cap=BOUNDED_ID_CAP)` treatment in `append()` below, not the raw-write

#: literal newline sailed through every one of those untouched. Every field named here now ALSO

#: POST-REVIEW FIX: the length a declared bounded-identifier field (slice/file/command_sha256) is
#: capped to, after flatten+scrub — deliberately shorter than FREE_TEXT_CAP. These are ids and
#: short paths, not prose: a legitimate `slice` id, a repo-relative file path, or a sha256 hex
#: digest (64 chars) is always well under 120; anything longer is already suspicious.
BOUNDED_ID_CAP = 120

#: Round-5 review finding 2: `merge_observed.subject` and `ci_observed.checks[].name` are
#: schema-validated (contract/validate.py) up to 256 chars, but were run through the generic
#: BOUNDED_ID_CAP (120, meant for short plan-authored ids) -- silently truncating an
#: already-validated fact to a DIFFERENT, shorter one, with no error anywhere, and the
#: truncated value still passes validate.py on read-back. `observation_key`/`merge_sha` in the
#: same EVENT_BOUNDED_ID_FIELDS entries are fixed-length hex hashes (64/40 chars) that never
#: reach 120 in the first place, so only these two need the schema's own, wider bound.
EVENT_SCHEMA_STRING_CAP = 256

#: Digits a numeric field may carry. A syntactic "parses as an int" check is NOT a safety check:
#: an arbitrary secret base-10-encoded as one integer parses cleanly, so without a bound it would
#: skip the scrubber and both caps and land raw, recoverable byte-for-byte with int(v).to_bytes().
#: 20 digits clears a signed 64-bit int, so every real duration, token count, cost and cycle fits
#: with room to spare.
#:
#: WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLOSE, stated plainly because an earlier version of this comment claimed it
#: did and that was false. A per-field bound does nothing against a payload SPLIT ACROSS fields: a
#: `phase` event carries three numeric fields, so ~24 bytes — enough for a whole AWS key — round-
#: trips in one legitimate `emit` call, and successive events cost nothing. That channel is
#: inherent to "a bounded numeric field trusts its own digits" and no cap can remove it.
#:
#: The accepted risk, stated at its real size. A first version of this note argued the gap was
#: cheap to accept because an agent that wants to exfiltrate can write
#: `.sdlc/ledger/events/<actor>-<host>.<pid>.jsonl` directly with a shell redirect anyway, so
#: closing the CLI
#: channel buys nothing. Review showed that reasoning is wrong, and the correction matters more
#: than the mechanics: it assumes the blast radius is the writer's own machine. It is not. The
#: events stream is PUSHED to the shared `sdlc-ledger` ops branch by the documented default path
#: (`sync.py bootstrap` — "pushes it so the team can see it"), and a downstream manager dashboard
#: reads it team-wide. There is currently no config that keeps it local: doctor reports that even
#: `share: false` "still publishes with the ledger, same as share: true", because the write side of
#: that flag is unimplemented (#244).
#:
#: So the honest statement is: a chunked secret entered through the SANCTIONED `loop.py emit` CLI
#: — the exact command an agent is told to run — reaches a shared team branch and a manager
#: dashboard whose readers trust it as sanitised. That is a different threat class from #140's
#: allowlist precedent, which is about an agent lying to ITSELF on one machine. A raw shell
#: redirect is unstoppable from in-process and genuinely out of scope; this is not that.
#:
#: It is still not fixed HERE, because no per-field bound can fix it — a `phase` event has three
#: numeric fields and successive events are free — and tightening the cap to a few digits would
#: break real values (a 27-hour `ms`, a seven-figure token count) while leaving the channel open.
#: The real mitigations are elsewhere and owned: #244 makes `share: false` actually keep events
#: local, and #248 covers whether ingested data can be trusted at all. Recorded on #141 so it is a
#: known accepted risk with the right size attached, not an inherited "local, so low-stakes".
NUMERIC_DIGIT_CAP = 20

#: The storability bound for every numeric field a downstream store maps to a column (issue #787). The digit cap
#: above bounds an ENCODED value's *length* (the #141 secret-bandwidth limit); it does NOT bound its
#: *magnitude* — 20 digits reaches 10**20-1, which overruns a signed 64-bit column. Every numeric
#: column the ledger feeds is at most 64-bit (`ms`/`tokens_*`/`cost_cents` are BIGINT, and #787
#: widened `cycle`/`exit_code` from 32-bit INTEGER to BIGINT so the guarantee is one width, not
#: three), so a value outside this range is a record a downstream ingester can never INSERT — it would
#: stall that writer's stream permanently. `_looks_numeric` refuses it at BOTH shared enforcement
#: points. Plain module constants, not a schema cross-import: a downstream reader must stay

    resolve to the SAME `who`. Two concurrent appends to one file then read the same `_line_count`
    and mint the same `id` (`shared:1 == shared:1`), breaking the monotonic-per-author guarantee the

    #540 extends the same reasoning one dimension out: a pid distinguishes two processes on ONE

    `sync.py`'s `publish()`/`bootstrap()` need this: unlike `read_all()`, which safely unions every
    `*.jsonl` in the directory, they must name exactly which files are (or might be) `who`'s to
    stage — never a teammate's.

    Matches the safe name exactly, never as a prefix: a naive `<safe>-*` glob would also match a
    DIFFERENT actor whose safe name happens to start with `<safe>-` (e.g. "team" matching
    "team-bot"'s files), so each candidate is split on its trailing `-<pid>` and the remainder is
    compared for equality first.

    #488: the comparison is CASE-INSENSITIVE. `pathlib.Path.glob()` is a pure Python string match
    that never consults the real filesystem's own case sensitivity, even where the filesystem IS
    case-insensitive (macOS APFS default, Windows NTFS) — so the old case-sensitive
    `{safe}-*.jsonl` glob could miss a file that a case-insensitive `open()` elsewhere in this
    module (`entry_file()`, via `append()`) happily wrote into, because `ledger.actor` in
    config.json is a hand-typed string whose casing can drift between runs (e.g. unset, so an
    earlier run fell back to `gh api user`'s lowercase login; a later hand-typed override uses
    different casing). Comparing case-insensitively closes that gap in BOTH directions, without
    needing to know which casing is "canonical": on a case-insensitive filesystem, two names that
    only differ by case were never two different actors to begin with. Real cross-actor collisions
    stay excluded by the same exact-match (post-lowercasing) guard above; for a `gh`-resolved
    actor that exact match is backed by GitHub's own case-insensitive username-uniqueness, and for

    `_scrub`) so a numeric field's definition of "valid" can never drift between the two

    TWO independent bounds, not belt-and-braces:

    NUMERIC_DIGIT_CAP bounds an encoded value's *length*. Parsing as an int says nothing about what
    the digits ENCODE: base-10-encoding a secret as one giant integer —
    `str(int.from_bytes(b"AKIA...|ghp_...", "big"))`, 118 digits — passes a purely syntactic check,
    so without the cap it skips the scrubber and lands raw, and `int(v).to_bytes()` reads it straight
    back off disk. The cap closes that channel's bandwidth below anything useful and closes the plain
    unbounded-length hole (50k digits written verbatim) in the same stroke, INCLUDING a small-
    magnitude value padded to great length (`"0" * 50000 + "5"` parses to 5 yet is 50k chars).

    The signed-64-bit RANGE check bounds *magnitude* (issue #787). It is the storability guarantee:
    the shared contract is that a value the CLI accepts is a value the ledger carries end to end, and
    every numeric column a downstream store maps is at most 64-bit. The signed-64-bit maximum is 19
    digits (2**63-1 == 9223372036854775807), so ANY 20-digit value exceeds it (a digit count cannot
    express the bound: some 19-digit values overrun it too), so a purely digit-counting bound let an
    in-spec CLI write
    produce a record a downstream ingester could never INSERT — permanently stalling that writer's stream.
    Counting digits cannot express this bound (`cycle`/`exit_code` were even narrower, 32-bit, before
    #787 widened them to BIGINT), so the range check carries it and the cap keeps its own length job.

    reaching them would create staged deletions in a live worktree and destroy a teammate's pull.
    Widening the scope later is additive; narrowing it after the fact would not be.

    That is ~3x the plan's own 7.5-8.7 ms figure, and the difference is real rather than noise: the
    plan measured a bare `glob('*.jsonl') + stat`, while this function also pays a `sorted()`, a
    `name.endswith` and an `lstat` per file for `_is_link`. The link check is a security
    requirement (S1), not an optimisation target, so the honest number is the one above.

    Acceptable once per process behind a 24h stamp; NOT acceptable per append, which is why the
    process flag and the stamp are both load-bearing rather than belt-and-braces. Not a claim about
    a network mount or a spinning disk.

    RETENTION RESETS `seq`, so a journal `id` is no longer unique for a project's lifetime — and

    how far its per-file counter got, so a later process that draws the same pid on the same host
    mints `<actor>:<host>.<pid>:1` again. MEASURED, by pinning `_instance_token` to model pid reuse
    and ingesting both rounds: nothing is lost, because the downstream ingester's seen-set keys on
    `id@ts` rather than `id`, and the second round ingested cleanly (3 event rows -> 6). Written down because
    that `@ts` suffix is now load-bearing for a reason that did not exist before #2574: before

    `mkdir` anywhere in this module's retention path. Control C-5 breaks exactly this.

    THE STAMP LIVES INSIDE THE JOURNAL DIRECTORY, not in `store_dir()` where `timing_store` keeps
    its own. That is what makes the early return sufficient: the stamp's parent IS the directory
    whose absence we just returned on, so by the time it is written the directory certainly exists
    and no `mkdir` is ever needed. The cost is that `.sdlc/events/` holds one non-`.jsonl` file —
    every reader glob and the sweep itself are `*.jsonl`, so nothing reads it by accident, but a
    count taken with `iterdir()` rather than a `*.jsonl` glob would see it."""

    """Append one line to THIS actor's file on the given stream. Returns the entry, or None
    when the ledger is off.

    `id` is `<actor>:<seq>` where seq counts this file's existing lines — monotonic per
    `(actor, stream)`, which is exactly what a watcher needs for a resume cursor, and needs no
    shared counter.

    `stream` defaults to `ENTRIES` (the pre-#136 behavior, byte-for-byte). `EVENTS` is a
    separate closed vocabulary (`EVENT_KINDS`/`EVENT_FIELDS`) written to its own per-actor file,
    so it can never collide with or dilute the entries kinds a lead reads in TEAM.md.

    Unknown `phase`/`gate`/`reason_class` VALUE does not raise — only `kind` (both streams) and
    `verdict` (events/`gate` only) are enforced, matching the issue's Done criteria verbatim.
    `PHASE_KINDS`/`GATE_KINDS`/`REASON_CLASSES` are the documented vocabulary but tightening
    them to enforced-at-write is a scope expansion later work can add, the same way `STATES`
    already does for entries, without another signature change.

    #2574/S1-G3: THE EVENTS GATE IS `journal_on(sdlc_dir, config)` — the journal switch, which is
    org policy first (a managed-settings lock and its 7-day lease) and then the local config's
    `journal.enabled` (the only key read; see `journal_settings`). It replaces the config
    read #244 had already decoupled from `enabled(config)` (the
    ledger's own flag); that decoupling survives unchanged — the journal writes with the team
    ledger off entirely, and ENTRIES stays gated on `enabled(config)` alone, untouched by the
    journal.

    DESTINATION NO LONGER ROUTES. Every EVENTS write lands in `local_events_dir(sdlc_dir)`
    (`.sdlc/events/`), whatever the config says. The old `share` setting — which chose between that
    path and the shared `entries_dir(sdlc_dir, EVENTS)` inside the ledger's own git worktree — is
    DELETED, with its routing helper, `entry_file(local=)` and `sync.py`'s staging of the
    events stream. PRD §6.2: "never published … git cannot hold events", so publishing is removed
    rather than defaulted off. `.sdlc/ledger/events/` is still READ for one release (doctor,
    `phase_report.py`'s crash repair, `time_report.py`, and a downstream reader, all unioning
    both directories), so an adopter's existing history stays visible; nothing writes it.

    That deletion also retires the "RESIDUAL, ACCEPTED, NOT SILENT" paragraph that stood here: the
    residual — a journal-on + `ledger.enabled: false` config writing into the ledger
    worktree's directory because destination keyed only on `share` — existed *because* destination
    keyed on `share`. With one destination, and that destination a gitignored sibling of
    `.sdlc/ledger/`, the combination it described cannot arise. Pinned by executed tests
    (`tests/test_ledger.py`'s EVENTS section), not merely asserted here.

    #2574/S1-G3: JOURNAL RETENTION RUNS FIRST, BEFORE THE STREAM VALIDATION AND BEFORE EITHER
    GATE. Placed after the gate it would never run on a journal-OFF install, which is the only
    case §6.2's retention exists for — a developer who turns the journal off is exactly the person
    whose old events nobody will ever come back for. That placement is what control C-4b breaks.
    It costs one `stat` per process (the flag), then one `stat` of the stamp, then at most one
    sweep per 24h across every process on the machine."""

      - `utf-8-sig` + `errors="replace"`: a plain-`utf-8` read raises `UnicodeDecodeError` (a
        ValueError, NOT an OSError, so the `except OSError` misses it) on one invalid byte, and a
        BOM on line 1 silently eats that record. `utf-8-sig` strips a leading BOM; `errors="replace"`
        turns an invalid byte into U+FFFD instead of aborting the whole read.
      - `except (ValueError, RecursionError)` around `json.loads`: a deeply nested line raises
        `RecursionError` (a RuntimeError, NOT a ValueError), which `except ValueError` alone lets
        propagate out of `read_all`, discarding every record already read. The tripping depth is
        interpreter-dependent, which is exactly why the TYPE is caught, not a threshold.
      - the sort key is `_sort_key` (below): the raw `(ts, actor, seq)` tuple raises `TypeError`
        the moment two records disagree on `ts`'s type, and `ValueError` on an absurd `id` tail —
        each fatal for the whole sort, not one line.
      - the directory walk is wrapped in `try/except OSError`: `Path.exists()` swallows only
        ENOENT/ENOTDIR/EBADF/ELOOP, so a directory the process cannot stat (mode 000) still escaped
        the old `if not base.exists()` gate. `glob()` already returns [] for a missing directory, so

    Two normalisations, and no more. The leading `@` is dropped, because it is a rendering

      - a DIFFERENT writer of the SAME actor: a legacy (pre-#337) claim has no pid to check

def _held(entries, now=None, ttl_seconds=None):
    """{goal: (actor, writer, ts)} for goals someone has `claimed` and whose lease has not yet
    ended — by a terminal SDLC outcome (done/parked/failed), or (#841) an explicit `release` of a
    claim that was never started, which is NOT a terminal outcome (the goal itself stays exactly
    as pending as it was before it was ever claimed) but ends the lease the same way the other
    three do. The shared computation behind `open_claims()` (actor only, the original,
    still-used-elsewhere contract) and `open_claims_detailed()` (F10.5/#374, adds writer so a
    caller can tell two of the SAME actor's own concurrent processes apart, not just two different
    actors). One computation, two views — never duplicate the state machine itself, or the two
    would silently drift the way F10's review found a downstream reader's independent reimplementation
    already had.

    The latest lifecycle entry per goal wins, so a re-claim after a failure re-opens the lease under
    whoever took it last. With `ttl_seconds` set, a claim older than that is treated as EXPIRED — a
    crashed claimer must never lock a goal for the whole team forever; `now` defaults to wall-clock
    and is injectable for tests. `entries` must be oldest-first (read_all guarantees it).

    POST-REVIEW FIX (PR #1107): a terminal-kind entry only clears `held[goal]` when its OWN actor
    still matches whoever `held[goal]` currently says holds the claim (or nothing is currently
    held — the no-op case `.pop(goal, None)` already covers). Previously this popped by GOAL alone,
    with no check of which actor/claim a terminal entry corresponds to. Reproduced: entries
    `[claimed(A), claimed(B), release(A)]` in that exact order — B legitimately re-claimed the goal
    (A's own claim gone stale/dead), then A's own delayed/stale `release` call physically lands
    AFTER B's claim in the sorted ledger — used to make `open_claims()` return `{}`, silently
    wiping B's live, currently-open claim out of the shared view even though B is actively working
    it; a THIRD actor could then legitimately `next`-pick the same goal B already holds, a genuine
    double-claim hazard. Now A's stale `release` finds `held[goal]`'s actor is B, not A, and leaves
    it untouched. Applied uniformly to done/parked/failed/release, not just release: the pop logic
    is shared code, and a stale done/parked/failed from a dead actor landing after a legitimate
    re-claim is the identical bug (narrower window in practice, since those are normally
    self-issued by whoever is currently finishing their OWN work, but nothing in this codebase
    enforces that — every entries-stream write self-attributes to `actor(config, run)`, the
    CURRENT process's own resolved identity, and no caller can write a done/parked/failed/release
    on a NAMED different actor's behalf, so there is no legitimate cross-actor scenario this could
    break; confirmed by reading every `_record`/`_release` call site in loop.py).

    PR #1235 REVIEW FIX (Finding 1/3): that last claim stopped being true the moment
    `loop.py`'s `_auto_reclaim_stale_claims` (#1198) started calling `_release()` on a DIFFERENT
    actor's stale claim — an automated crash-recovery sweep, by definition, runs as whichever
    actor's process happens to execute it, not as the original (possibly long-dead) claimant. Its
    `release` entry's own `actor` field is still, correctly, self-attributed to the SWEEP's actor
    (an honest audit trail: this records who actually performed the reclaim) — but that means the
    actor-scoped check above, alone, could never end the ORIGINAL claimant's lease: a cross-actor
    reclaim left `held[goal]` unchanged forever, re-detected as "expired" on every subsequent read
    and re-released (with a fresh duplicate GitHub audit comment) on every subsequent call. Fixed
    by a SECOND, narrower path into the SAME pop, scoped to `release` entries alone: one may also
    name, via `reclaimed_actor`, the specific actor whose claim it is ending on that actor's
    behalf (never on a NAMED different actor's behalf for done/parked/failed — a genuinely
    completed/blocked/broken goal is always self-reported by whoever was doing the work, so that
    half of the original claim still holds). This is not a re-opening of the #1107 hazard: the
    check is still against `current[0]` — whoever the LEDGER's own replay currently says holds the
    claim at this point in the ordered history — so a legitimate different actor who re-claimed
    the goal AFTER the stale one (and before this release entry) still leaves `current[0]`
    pointing at THEM, not at `reclaimed_actor`, and the pop correctly does not fire. See
    `test_a_reclaimed_actor_release_does_not_wipe_a_different_actors_live_reclaim`
    (tests/test_ledger.py) for the exact race proven safe.

    #1121 REVIEW FOLLOW-UP (from #841's own review): the actor-scoped guard above is still
    coarser than the real hazard — it cannot tell apart two DIFFERENT, concurrent PROCESSES
    authenticated as the exact SAME nominal actor (e.g. two independent sigma sessions both
    running as one person's own `gh` login). Same shape as the #1107 repro, just same-actor instead of
    cross-actor: `[claimed(A, run=1), claimed(A, run=2), release(A, run=1)]` — A's own SECOND
    process legitimately re-claims the goal (A's first process gone stale/dead), then A's first
    process's own delayed/stale `release` lands after it; actor-only scoping cannot distinguish
    these two `A`s and wipes the live reclaim exactly like the #1107 bug did.

    Fixed by additionally scoping the primary (non-`reclaimed_actor`) branch by `run_id` — #498's
    `state.run_identity()`/`SIGMA_RUN_ID`, the one per-process-tree identity that already
    exists for exactly this class of problem (see `loop.py`'s own `verify_goal` for its other,
    independent use of the same mechanism) — tracked in a side dict (`held_run`) that mirrors
    `held`'s own lifecycle but is NEVER part of THIS function's *returned* shape: `open_claims()`,
    `open_claims_detailed()`, `expired_claims()`, and (outside this plugin) a downstream reader's
    differential tests all unpack `_held()`'s values as a 3-tuple today, so widening what gets
    RETURNED here would be a breaking change to every one of them for a distinction only the
    pop-decision below needs (`_held_full()`, below, exposes `held_run` to the one internal
    caller — `expired_claim_run_ids()` — that legitimately needs it without touching this
    contract). `run_id` degrades to exactly today's actor-only behavior — no regression for a
    caller that never sets `SIGMA_RUN_ID` — whenever EITHER side lacks one: a legacy/
    unattributed claim or terminal entry gives this function nothing to compare, so it falls back
    to the pre-#1121 actor-only answer rather than refusing a legitimate release.
    See `test_two_concurrent_processes_of_the_same_actor_do_not_race_via_a_stale_terminal_entry`
    (tests/test_ledger.py) for the exact race proven safe.

    PR #1269 REVIEW FIX (blocking finding 1): the `reclaimed_actor` branch just above was, until
    this fix, run-scoped NOT AT ALL — reasoned (incorrectly) as: an automated reclaim sweep's own
    `release` entry is, by construction, a DIFFERENT process (and so a different `run_id`) than
    the stale claim it is ending, so comparing `run_id` there would make the path never fire
    again, reopening #1235. That reasoning conflated two different run_ids: the WRITER's own
    (`entry.get("run_id")`, the sweep's — correctly never compared here, or #1235 WOULD reopen)
    and the STALE CLAIM's own (what `reclaimed_actor` already names explicitly for the actor
    axis). `reclaimed_run` closes exactly that gap, the same "name the target, not the writer"
    pattern `reclaimed_actor` itself already uses, one level finer: a release naming
    `reclaimed_actor=amy, reclaimed_run="run-1"` only pops the lease if `held_run[goal]` is STILL
    "run-1" — if amy's own SECOND, concurrent process has since re-claimed the goal under
    "run-2" (a live re-claim landing in the real window `_auto_reclaim_stale_claims` opens
    between reading `expired_claims()`/`expired_claim_run_ids()` and finally writing its release —
    loop.py's own docstring on that function names this window explicitly), `current_run` is
    "run-2", `reclaimed_run` is "run-1", they disagree, and the pop correctly does not fire — the
    identical (actor, run) discipline the primary branch already applies, just sourced from the
    NAMED target instead of the entry's own writer. Degrades to the pre-fix, actor-only answer
    whenever `reclaimed_run` is absent (an older release entry, or a caller that never threaded
    `expired_claim_run_ids()` through) — same no-regression contract every other run_id axis here
    already has. See `test_a_stale_reclaimed_actor_release_does_not_wipe_the_same_actors_live_
    reclaim_by_another_run` and `test_run_id_scoping_never_reopens_the_1235_cross_actor_

    OWN `run_id` (never the sweep's own) to thread through `_release()` as `reclaimed_run`, so

    docstring for the exact mechanism and `OPTIONAL_FIELDS`' docstring for why `reclaimed_run` is
    sourced this way, mirroring `reclaimed_actor`'s own `expired_claims()` sourcing exactly.

    A goal whose stale claim never carried a `run_id` (legacy/unattributed, or any caller that
    never set `SIGMA_RUN_ID`) is simply absent here — `_release()` then writes
    `reclaimed_run=None`, and `_held()`'s own `reclaimed_run_matches` degrades to the pre-#1269
