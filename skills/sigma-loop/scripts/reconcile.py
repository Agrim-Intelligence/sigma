"""#1391 step 5a: the CENSUS — a read-only survey of every issue Sigma is responsible for, and
what state each one is actually in.

WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE MODULE, not an extension of `auto_unpark.py`. That module's own docstring
makes its narrowness a permanent promise ("this sweep only ever reverses the ONE park class it can
prove is stale, never guesses at any other"). Folding general drift-detection into it would break
that contract. This module is built to the same SHAPE — pure `compute_*`/`census` functions, a
`sweep_*` orchestrator, a `render_*`, a CLI verb, and a mechanism that is unconditional once called
with the config gate living only at the unattended call site — but owns a different question.

★ THE ABSENCE TRAP, and why this enumerates the POPULATION rather than the corruption.
A label query can only ever return issues that HAVE the label you name. The worst corruption class
in this system is an issue with NO lifecycle label at all — and no label query on earth returns it.
`doctor._multi_state_label_scan` is blind to that class by construction, because it asks four label
queries and flags issues appearing in more than one. So this module never asks "which issues are
broken?". It asks "which issues am I responsible for?", then classifies each one locally. The
difference is the whole design.

★ IT OWNS ITS OWN READS. Deliberately NOT built on:
  - `mirror.fetch_and_write` / `board-mirror.ndjson` — gated on `backlog_check.enabled`, which ships
    FALSE. The "205 records already live" measurement that suggested reusing it was taken on this
    repo's own NON-default config.
  - the ledger — `ledger.enabled` also ships FALSE, and on the one adopter with real in-flight work
    `open_claims()` is `{}` against 7 in-progress issues.
Building the recovery layer on a subsystem that ships disabled is the exact failure shape that sank
two previous attempts at this area. Every read here works on a stock config.

Step 5a is READ-ONLY. It computes and reports; it never writes a label, moves a card, or touches an
issue. The correction tiers (5c AUTOMATIC / 5d PROPOSED) are separate, later, and gated.

    admitted to it yet (`proposed_label`). Carrying more than one of THOSE is a real contradiction.

    `in_progress_label` is deliberately NOT here: it is an orthogonal, additive marker that
    legitimately co-occurs with the goal label on every actively-worked issue (#1354 documents this,
    and treating it as primary would flag normal work as corruption). It IS fetched separately below
    — an issue carrying it and nothing else is the invisible orphan class this census exists to
    find — but it never participates in the "more than one" test.

    #1393: `goal_blocked_label` is NOT here either, for the same reason and by the same rule.
    `mark_blocked` now KEEPS `goal_label` — `sdlc:blocked` became a temporary OVERLAY rather than an
    exit — so `goal`+`blocked` is the correct, normal shape of a blocked goal. Leaving it in this
    tuple made the census report every properly-blocked goal on the board as multi-label corruption,
    and worse: the PROPOSAL tier would then offer "corrections" against a state the loop creates on
    purpose, i.e. the reconciler proposing to break working goals.

    It is still FETCHED as an overlay below (the same treatment `in_progress_label` gets), so a
    closed issue left carrying it, or one carrying it and no membership label at all, is still
    found — only the "more than one" test changed.

    #1579: this now DELEGATES to `GitHubSource.membership_labels()` instead of restating the tuple.
    The two were byte-identical, and a second copy of this vocabulary is exactly the defect class
    #1393 measured — five of six hand-written copies of the eligibility rule had drifted from each
    other — just not yet triggered. `config` stays in the signature because every caller passes it
    and because `_managed_hints`, the neighbour with the same shape, genuinely needs it; here it is

    Given a name of its own precisely because removing `goal_blocked_label` from `_primary_labels`

    this census exists to find:

      1. an OPEN issue carrying only `sdlc:blocked` (membership lost to a partial write from an

    `truncated` (#1579) is that same point one step further out, and it became load-bearing with the

# carrying `sdlc:goal` + `sdlc:parked` and deliberately REFUSED to auto-fix it, because nothing in
# the data model could say which label was true. GitHub's issue timeline can.
#
# MEASURED, live, before this was written:
#   - `timelineItems(itemTypes:[LABELED_EVENT, UNLABELED_EVENT])` returns every label add/remove
#     with `createdAt`, `actor.login` and `label.name`. Replaying it reconstructs the CURRENT label
#     set byte-exactly on 130/130 issues tested, with zero issues missing history. It is lossless.
#   - Cost is ~1 GraphQL point per 25-issue batch (5 points for all 121 legacy cases).
#   - GraphQL, NOT REST: GraphQL resolves label names LIVE, so it self-heals across a rename (the
#     #1348 `sdlc:proposed` -> `sdlc:needs-confirmation` rename would otherwise poison replay).
#     REST returns the historical snapshot and would report the old name.
#   - All 8 live multi-label tangles across both real repos resolve unambiguously by last-add-wins,
#     with a MINIMUM separation of 1.1 HOURS between the competing adds, while a real `_offboard`
#     transaction spans 4 SECONDS. Three orders of magnitude. #226 resolves to `parked` by a
#     45.8-hour margin.
#
# That gap is what makes the window below safe: inside it, two adds are one transaction and cannot
# be told apart, so we REFUSE. Outside it, they are separate intents and the later one is current.

#: Two primary-label adds closer together than this are one transaction, not two intents. Set from
#: the measured gap above with ~4 orders of magnitude of headroom on the transaction side and ~2 on
#: the intent side. Widening it trades false "ambiguous" for false confidence; do not raise it

# The ONLY class corrected without a human, and it is deliberately the narrowest one that is
# provably safe: a CLOSED issue still carrying `in_progress_label` or a not-eligible OVERLAY.
#
# WHY THIS CLASS AND NOTHING ELSE. An adversarial review of the corrector design found that its
# worst realistic harm is releasing a goal whose worker is still live — worktree paths are
# deterministic, and `_release()` clears both the claim and the liveness marker, so the next picker
# attaches to a LIVE agent's directory and runs `git add -A` there. That harm requires an OPEN goal
# a picker can serve. It cannot occur here: every picker query filters `--state open`, so a closed
# issue is unreachable by the picker by construction, has no claim, and has no worker. Stripping a
# stale label from it can wake nothing up.
#
# What it fixes is real and pre-loaded: 137 closed issues on this repo alone carry stale state.
# Each is inert TODAY and becomes a live orphan the moment someone reopens it.
#
# The membership label is NEVER touched — a closed issue keeping `sdlc:goal` is the designed
# terminal state (and the reason the 334 such issues here need no migration).

#: An issue closed more sec ago than this is not mid-transition. A real `_offboard` spans ~4 seconds;
#: this is ~5 orders of magnitude of headroom, and it also means a human who closes an issue by hand
#: has a full day to fix its labels before anything automatic touches them.
CLOSED_SETTLE_SECONDS = 24 * 3600

#: Never correct more than this many issues in one sweep. A corrector that suddenly rewrites
#: hundreds of issues is indistinguishable from a runaway, and the backlog it is fixing is not
#: urgent — 137 stale issues drain in a few sweeps and nothing is worse for waiting.

    #1393 corrects two bugs here that an adversarial audit found, and they pull in opposite
    directions — one made this strip too much, the other too little:

      TOO MUCH: it used to compute the stale set as "every primary label except `goal_label`",
      which since the membership refactor means `sdlc:parked` and `sdlc:needs-confirmation`. Those
      are MEMBERSHIP labels, not overlays — a human's park and a human's withheld approval. Feeding
      them to the AUTOMATIC (ungated, no-human) correction tier meant a closed-and-parked issue
      would have its park silently stripped, and a closed proposal its approval gate. A closed issue
      keeping a membership label is the designed terminal state; only the overlays are stale.

      TOO LITTLE: `goal_blocked_label` was not in the set at all once it left `primary`, so a closed
      issue carrying `sdlc:blocked` was flagged by `classify` as CLOSED_WITH_STATE and then never
      corrected — the census reporting an anomaly the corrector could not act on, forever.

    Both disappear by naming the OVERLAYS explicitly, which is what "stale on a closed issue" always
    meant: reopen it and a false ACTIVITY state comes back to life.

    #1445 ADDS `goal_label` to that set, which REVISES the sentence above ("a closed issue keeping a
    membership label is the designed terminal state"). Stated plainly rather than quietly, because it
    narrows an explicit prior decision:

      * #1393's actual bug was `sdlc:parked` and `sdlc:needs-confirmation` being stripped -- those
        record a HUMAN's decision (a park, a withheld approval) and must survive a close. That half
        is UNCHANGED and still deliberate.
      * `goal_label` is not a human decision; it is "the loop may pick this". On a closed issue it
        asserts membership of a queue the issue cannot be in, and it contradicts the documented
        terminal state ("a Done issue carries no `sdlc:*` label"). It also fails this docstring's
        OWN test: reopen the issue and it silently re-enters the queue without anyone re-approving
        it, which is exactly the false state this function exists to prevent.

    So the rule is now: on a closed issue the OVERLAYS are stale, and so is MEMBERSHIP-BY-GOAL;
    membership that encodes a human decision is not."""

# --- #2295 (design #2287 detailed design section 2): promote DECISIVE open-issue --------
# corrections from the PROPOSED tier to AUTOMATIC.
#
# B-1 (the design's own blocker): this is a NEW, not-yet-adversarially-reviewed write mechanism on
# OPEN issues — a different risk class from the closed-issue AUTOMATIC tier above, whose own
# corrector-harm review is BR-4's cited precedent. So unlike that tier (deliberately UNGATED once
# `sweep_reconcile` is called — module docstring, "a direct call IS the opt-in"), this one carries
# its OWN config gate, checked INSIDE `sweep_reconcile` itself rather than only at loop.py's
# unattended call site. That is a deliberate departure from this module's usual gating philosophy,
# and it is deliberate for exactly one reason: `discovery.reconcile.mode` already means something
# else (BR-4's reviewed, closed-issue-only tier) on every repo that has already turned it on, and a
# repo with `mode: "on"` must not silently start auto-applying to OPEN issues the moment this code
# ships. `open_issue_mode` is therefore a SEPARATE, independently-off-by-default sub-key of the same
# `discovery.reconcile` block, not a second meaning bolted onto `mode` — the conservative reading of
# an ambiguous design instruction, recorded here rather than assumed silently.

      1. the issue must STILL carry no primary label at all — if one is already present, something
         else already changed it, and re-adding a label now would be a second, unreviewed write on
         top of whatever already happened;
      2. the most-recently-removed primary label, by the FRESH history, must still be the same one

    the caller (`sweep_reconcile`); this function re-verifies eligibility per item regardless, on
    the premise that census time and write time are different moments.

    THE NEW SAFEGUARD (design #2287 detailed design section 2, round-2 goal-review):
    `apply_proposal`'s existing re-read (`reconcile.py:794-833` at review time) only re-verifies the
    SPECIFIC labels already queued for change are still stale — never the eligibility CONDITION
    itself. A human can act on the same issue in the window between `census()` and this write (most
    concretely: deliberately re-parking an issue the census saw as MULTI_LABEL
    `{goal_label, parked_label}` by removing `goal_label` themselves, leaving only `parked_label`) —
    `apply_proposal`'s check would still see the queued `remove: [parked_label]` present in a fresh
    read and still remove it, silently undoing the human's own re-park and leaving the issue with
    NEITHER label. So this function re-fetches the issue fresh, re-fetches its label HISTORY fresh,
    and re-derives the winner from that fresh evidence (`_recompute_winner`) BEFORE ever computing a
    label diff — mirroring `apply_closed_state_actions`'s own shape (a fresh re-check of the
    eligibility condition, not just of the specific labels) at `reconcile.py:579-624`.

    The closed-issue tier is UNGATED once called, exactly like `auto_unpark.sweep_unpark` and
    `triage.enact` — a direct call (this module's CLI, or a human) IS the opt-in. The
    `discovery.reconcile.mode` config gate belongs at the unattended call site (`loop.py`), not
    here. The open-issue promotion tier is DIFFERENT and DELIBERATELY NOT UNGATED — see the block
    comment above `_open_issue_promotion_mode` for why it carries its own gate checked right here,
    regardless of caller.

    REFUSES on an incomplete census. Correction is a diff against what the census saw, so acting on
    a partial read risks "correcting" from data that was never fully gathered. A skipped pass costs
    nothing; the corruption the closed-issue tier fixes is inert by construction (closed issues) and
    waits happily.

    #1579 brings TRUNCATION under that same refusal, and the tradeoff is named rather than assumed.
    "Waits happily" stops being true at the ceiling: the population this corrector shrinks is the
    same one whose size caused the truncation, so refusing forever means it never shrinks. That
    deadlock was accepted over the alternative (correct from a knowingly partial read) for three
    reasons — it is far away (5000 closed issues on ONE label; 24 here, ~350 on `os`), it cannot be
    reached silently (`_warn_truncated` on stderr, `render_census`, and doctor's row all say so),
    and `_incomplete_reason` prints the one-line remedy in the refusal itself. A refusal that tells
    you how to clear it is not a deadlock in practice; a partial read that presents as complete is
    the bug this whole flag exists to prevent. The same refusal covers the open-issue tier too — it
