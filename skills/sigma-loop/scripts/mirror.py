"""Local board mirror — a token-free, gitignored snapshot of the GitHub backlog for the backlog
cross-check (0.9.20). ONE batched `gh issue list` for OPEN `sdlc:goal` issues + ONE for recently-closed
issues, normalized to the fields the cross-check index needs, written as NDJSON under
`.sdlc/state/board-mirror.ndjson` (which `/sigma-setup` gitignores — issue titles/bodies can carry client
strings, so the mirror never rides a PR). Body excerpts are scrubbed too (defense in depth).

ONE field is derived from the FULL body rather than the 500-character excerpt: `blocker_refs`
(#1487). A blocker scan needs an EXACT reference, not a representative sample, and the markers
are written at the END of a body -- see `normalize_issue`. Only the issue number and the
trigger phrase are kept, never surrounding text.

Read-only against GitHub; reaches it only through an injectable `run` (default `sources._run_gh`), so
tests are hermetic — no network, no `gh`. FAIL-OPEN: not github mode / no `gh` / offline / any error =>
no mirror written, returns None; the cross-check then degrades to the ledger + local goal files.

A well-formed but EMPTY result (#1496) is treated the same way — not as an answer. A rate-limited or
scope-reduced `gh` can succeed with zero issues, and that is indistinguishable on the wire from a
board that genuinely has none; writing it would clobber a good, populated mirror with nothing, and a
cleared mirror reads to the cross-check as "checked, found nothing" rather than "could not check".

    `blocker_refs` (#1487) is deliberately NOT an input, and the honest reason is not the one an
    earlier draft of this comment gave. Two facts, both checked rather than assumed:

      - NOTHING under `skills/` reads `content_hash` today. It is written here and asserted in
        `tests/test_mirror.py`; the embedding cache that the "skips re-embedding" sentence above
        describes keys on `d["raw"]` instead (`backlog_check._dense_channel`), i.e. on
        `title + "\n" + body_excerpt`. So this is a decision about the shape a FUTURE consumer
        would inherit, not one with a live consumer behind it.
      - For that future consumer the inputs should be exactly what feeds the work being skipped,
        and `blocker_refs` feeds neither tokenizing nor embedding -- it is read by
        `backlog_check._record_blocker_refs` alone. Including it would move the key on records
        whose tokenized content is unchanged.

    The one case where `blocker_refs` can change while title/excerpt/`updated_at` all hold still is
    a change to the EXTRACTION rule itself (this release narrows it). That is a whole-mirror
    concern, not a per-record one, and `SCHEMA`/`is_fresh` already handle it by refusing the entire
    stale mirror -- which is strictly stronger than a per-record hash miss would be."""

def normalize_issue(raw):
    """Pure: one `gh issue list --json` object -> the normalized, scrubbed mirror record. Raises
    (TypeError/ValueError) on a row with no usable number, so build_records can skip it.

    `blocker_refs` (#1487) is scanned off the FULL title+body, not the excerpt. The excerpt cap is
    right for what it was sized for -- "enough for an optional rerank" -- and similarity scoring
    degrades gracefully on a truncated body. A regex for a SPECIFIC `#N` reference does not degrade;
    it just returns nothing. Since `compile_plan` appends `**Blocked by:** #N` at the END of a body,
    every issue longer than 500 characters had its dependency silently unenforced (measured: a real
    18-issue plan where `next-batch` claimed 8 goals, 7 with an open prerequisite). Scanning once
    here costs nothing at check time and keeps the excerpt at the size it was chosen for.

    The scan is NARROWER than the check-time one, deliberately: `blocker_scan.extract_refs` uses
    `EXPLICIT_TRIGGERS` (`blocked by` / `depends on` / `depends upon`), not the full `TRIGGERS` set.
    The weak triggers were calibrated against the 500-character excerpt and 395 of 400 real issues
    exceed it, so pointing them at whole bodies emitted a confident `blocked-by` edge off narrative
    prose ("...a real user hit it after Phase 2 (#1396) went live") -- and a confident edge is not
    advisory, it drives `blockers.resolve` to WRITE to the referenced issue. Measured on this
    repo's own board the narrowing keeps 21 of 21 genuine edges and drops the phantom. See
    `blocker_scan.TRIGGERS` for the full rationale.

    What lands on the record is a decimal issue number plus one phrase from that closed trigger set
    -- never surrounding body text -- so this reads MORE of the body than the mirror stores without
    weakening the secret-safety the excerpt cap and `scrub()` provide. Note the ORDER this depends
    on: `body` is scrubbed BEFORE it is scanned, so the new path never sees unredacted text.

    Deliberately NOT folded into `content_hash` -- see that function's own note for why.

    #1833: `updated_at`/`closed_at` read EITHER key spelling -- `gh issue list --json` normalizes
    these to camelCase (`updatedAt`/`closedAt`, GraphQL-shaped), while `gh api`'s raw REST issues
    endpoint (what `fetch_and_write`/`fetch_dependency_records` now fetch through) returns them
    snake_case (`updated_at`/`closed_at`) instead -- confirmed live, the same naming split
    `_sync_backlog`'s own REST migration ran into with `title`/`body`/`number`/`labels` (those four
    happen to be spelled identically in both shapes, so needed no such fallback). Camelcase is
    tried FIRST so every existing camelCase-fixtured test in this file keeps passing unchanged;
    REST's raw response simply never has that key, so the fallback engages for it and only it."""

    search (#1204) -- deliberately NOT `fetch_and_write`'s own open query above, and never reads or
    writes the shared `board-mirror.ndjson` that query maintains.

    Two corpus gaps make the regular mirror unusable for this: (1) its open query applies
    `discovery.github.assignee` when configured (`fetch_and_write`, above) -- a follow-up filed by a
    different person/session is invisible to a search that reuses it unchanged, exactly the blind
    spot #1204 exists to close; (2) it filters open issues to ONE label (`discovery.github.
    goal_label`, default `sdlc:goal`) -- a queued follow-up (`sdlc:needs-confirmation`, withholding
    `sdlc:goal` by design, see handoff.py's PROPOSED_LABEL) never matches it, so follow-ups could
    never dedup against each other. This function fixes both: no assignee filter ever, and one
    `gh issue list --label <L>` call PER label in `labels` (issued separately and merged rather than
    combined into one `--label a,b` query, which `gh` ANDs rather than ORs -- a caller wants "carries
    EITHER label", not "carries both").

    The closed-issue side is unchanged from `fetch_and_write`'s own: no label filter (completed work
    can obsolete/duplicate a follow-up even if it never carried a goal label), no assignee filter
    (already the case above).

    Always live, no TTL cache -- this runs only at the moment the loop is about to file a brand-new
    issue, never on the hot pick path, so one extra `gh` round-trip here is cheap next to the cost of
    a genuine duplicate going unnoticed.

    Returns normalized records in the exact shape `build_records` produces (deduplicated by number,
    an open record winning over a closed one on a clash) -- so a caller (dedup.find_candidates via
    `records=`) can treat this corpus identically to the regular mirror's, whichever path produced
    it. FAIL-OPEN: not github mode / no gh / any error -> None, never a raise -- the caller degrades
    to filing without a duplicate check, exactly as it did before this existed.

    function, no `_list_only_run` wrapper is needed here: a malformed per-label or closed response
    degrading to an empty list (`fetch_issues_rest`'s own behavior on a non-list JSON payload) is
    ALREADY this function's own pre-#1833 contract for both (`if isinstance(raw, list):
