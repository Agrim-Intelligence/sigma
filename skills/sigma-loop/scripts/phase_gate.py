"""The phase-record gate (#684): a goal is not `done` until the action log shows each SDLC phase.

WHY. The loop's one-subagent-per-phase rule was prose. A live run had one worker do every phase inline
and `record done` accepted it with no research, plan, plan-review or retro on record. Dispatch happens on
the HOST's side and no code here can see it, so this module does the one thing Python can do on every
host and in every mode: it reads the goal's own action-log file and REFUSES `done` unless the record
shows, in order, research, plan, plan-review (an approving verdict), implement (started after that
verdict), review (an approving verdict) and retro.

WHAT IT PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. Rows are written by `phase_report.py start|end`, by
`work.py record-plan-review` and `work.py record-review`, and by `loop.py waive-phases`. A maker can call
those verbs itself, exactly as it can call `record-plan-review` today; so the record proves that a phase
boundary and a verdict were RECORDED, in order, bound to the plan's bytes. For a verdict whose route is
`subagent` (the host can dispatch) it also proves every phase named its own agent id, no id served two
phases, and, where the host's transcript store is readable at record time, that a transcript for each
phase's agent id exists. A reviewer resumed for a second verdict counts as the same agent (use a fresh one). On an `inline` route (the host cannot spawn one) none of that applies; the
record says INLINE and `loop.py phases` shows it. It does not
prove the phase's work was good. Research and retro are boundary-proof only. When the transcript store
is not readable the verdict is stored `unverified` and `loop.py phases` says so.

LEVER. `loop.py waive-phases <sdlc> <goal> research,retro --reason ...` waives research and retro only
(plan, plan-review, implement and review can never be waived), recorded as `phase_waived` rows and
printed. `gates.phase_record.enabled: false` switches the gate off. Absent key = off (an adopted repo is
not retro-fitted); `/sigma-init` ships it true. Gate on with `action_log.enabled` not true REFUSES: it
cannot verify, and a half-guarantee is worse than a refusal.
