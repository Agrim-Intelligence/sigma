"""Read-only board survey (1/4) + the dependency-sequenced drain-plan compiler (2/4) + enact (3/4)
-- sigma-triage.

`survey`: nine fail-open buckets over the live GitHub board (or local .sdlc/goals/ in non-github
mode): inbox, active, parked/blocked, enqueued backlog, shadow backlog, epics/needs-decomposition,
hygiene gaps, dependency edges, context. NEVER writes -- no ledger append, no gh mutation, no
label/status change.

Buckets 2-8 derive from ONE retried `gh issue list` fetch (assignee-scoped exactly like
`next_pending`, same eventual-consistency retry posture) rather than one call per bucket -- body
text for up to 200 issues is already the dominant payload; nine separate fetches would be nine
times that cost for no extra signal. (One bounded exception, #706: on a board-enabled repo the
`enqueued` bucket also makes the Ready-lane existence check, at most two further `gh project`
calls -- see `_bucket_enqueued`'s own docstring for the cost accounting; it is not a second issue
fetch and every other repo shape pays nothing extra.)

`plan`: turns a confirmed pick (`--pick n[,n...]`, `--edge BLOCKED:BY`, `--defer n:reason`) into a
dependency-sequenced drain plan in capped waves, written as three artifacts under
`.sdlc/plans/triage/`. Pure compile -- ZERO network, zero ledger writes, under every DEFAULT input
(`--from-survey <file>` optionally supplies titles/priority/model/edges offline). The one
deliberate, opt-in exception (#713): `--resolve-missing N` makes up to N bounded `gh issue view`
calls for picks the survey snapshot doesn't cover (GitHub's search index is only eventually
consistent, so a just-labelled issue can be genuinely absent moments after filing) -- every input
that omits this flag keeps the original, unconditional zero-network guarantee; see `plan_cmd`'s
own docstring for exactly where the exception is scoped.

`enact`: compiles an ALREADY-COMPILED `plan` JSON artifact into the loop's own native primitives --
assignment, `sdlc:goal`/`priority:*`/`model:*` labels (add-only-what's-missing, idempotent), the
v1-lite unpark (drop `sdlc:parked`, re-add `sdlc:goal`), and a `**Blocked by:** #N` body marker per
dependency edge (via `sources.append_to_body`, deduped against what `backlog_check._BLOCK_RE`
already detects) -- so sequencing rides the loop's EXISTING park-on-blocked behavior with zero
changes to loop.py/next_pending. Dry-run by default; `--apply` executes the identical, already-
computed action list. Deferred/dropped issues are never read or written. Zero ledger writes.

    """(issues, degraded) for every open issue in scope -- ONE (possibly paginated) REST fetch,
    retried on the same two triggers `sources.GitHubSource.next_pending` established (F447): a
    transient exception, or an empty page (GitHub's search index is only eventually consistent).
    Retry constants AND the fetch ceiling are READ off `sources.GitHubSource` live, never copied
    (a value read fresh every call cannot drift from its source -- a prior drift class here,
    scrub.py/research_capture.py, the two gate scripts). The ceiling is `_BOARD_ITEM_LIMIT`
    (#706 §2c): #692 raised it for the board calls specifically because `gh`'s own `--limit` is a
    maximum, not a page size (a higher ceiling costs nothing on a small board) -- that insight
    applies equally to this broader, unfiltered fetch, so it reads the SAME constant rather than
    keeping the old `200` (which was never actually the ceiling #692 raised -- see
    `_PICKER_WINDOW` below for the ceiling that is still 200, and matters for a different reason).

    #1833: migrated off `gh issue list --state open --search sort:created-asc ...` onto the
    shared `sources.fetch_issues_rest` REST helper `_fetch_pending`/`list_needs_label`/
    `_sync_backlog` already use -- `--search` alone (no `--label` at all here; this fetch is
    UNSCOPED by label, unlike every other migrated call site) is itself always graphql-search-
    billed against the shared 5000/hour `graphql` resource, by construction (`--search` literally
    routes `gh` through the `search()` field) -- confirmed by #1829's own live research, which
    named this exact call site as sharing the defect but out of its own scope (off the
    `next`/`next-batch` pick path; this one only runs behind the human-invoked `/sigma-triage`).
    `state=open` and `sort=created&direction=asc` are REST parameters native to the endpoint, so
    no search-qualifier string is needed for either. `assignee` (which may be the kit's own
    documented `"@me"` convention) is resolved to a real login FRESH EACH ATTEMPT via
    `sources.resolve_assignee_login` -- mirroring `_fetch_pending`'s own per-attempt resolution
    exactly, for the exact same reason: REST's `assignee=` has no `"@me"` alias of its own (a hard
    422, confirmed live), so a resolution failure on one attempt must not permanently unscope
    every later retry.

    The old requested-fields comment (`title+body is the payload cost; createdAt is dropped, no
    bucket consumes it`) no longer applies: REST has no field-selection concept at all, so every
    field comes back on every fetch regardless -- at no extra request cost either way, since it
    was always exactly this one (possibly paginated) fetch. Ordering is NOT baked into this fetch
    (#706 docs sweep: the old comment here claimed a `number` sort "same as next_pending's own
    qualifiers" -- stopped being true the moment #698 made priority the default order) -- the
    `sort=created&direction=asc` pair only fixes which page is returned on a backlog deeper than
    the fetch ceiling; the enqueued bucket's own display order comes from `gh_source._pick_key`
    (or the pre-#706 number sort when `gh_source is None`), applied after this fetch, in
    `_bucket_enqueued`.

    Assignee-scoped exactly like `next_pending`. `degraded` carries `"gh_unavailable"` on exhausted
    retries/non-transient failure, `"gh_unparseable"` when `run()` succeeds but its stdout is not
    valid JSON (a gh upgrade-notice line, truncated output, or an HTML error page -- PR #677
    review finding 1: `json.loads` used to sit OUTSIDE this guard, so any of those crashed the
    whole survey with a raw traceback instead of degrading), or `"truncated"` on a saturated page
    (renamed from the old literal `"truncated_at_200"` -- #706 F3: that string would lie the
    moment the ceiling changes again, the exact drift class #692 was about) -- propagated onto
    every bucket derived from this fetch, see `survey()`."""

def _bucket_enqueued(issues, gh_cfg, gh_source=None):
    """Open `sdlc:goal` issues, in the order `GitHubSource.next_pending` would actually serve them
    -- `gh_source._pick_key` sorts directly (the bound method, zero copy of the ranking/tie-break
    logic: order, priority prefix, and the priority-vs-created branch all live in exactly one
    place, sources.py's own). `gh_source is None` (construction failed, or no gh_source supplied at
    all -- most direct unit tests) falls back to `(0, number)`, byte-identical to the pre-#706
    plain-ascending issue-number sort. Also excludes in-progress issues, which `next_pending`'s
    OWN label filter technically would not (only `sdlc:parked` excludes there -- an abandoned
    in-progress goal is meant to be re-pickable): a genuinely active issue is already shown under
    `active`, and listing it again here would read as "not yet started" for a goal that plainly is.
    A refinement for this human-facing survey, not a literal byte-for-byte mirror of the raw
    picker's own filter.

    Two `degraded` markers this bucket alone can raise (neither is a nicety -- see #706 F1/F6):

    - `"exceeds_picker_window"`: the real picker's own fetch (`_pending_by_label`) is still capped
      at `_PICKER_WINDOW` (200) even though `_list_open_issues` above now reads a much higher
      ceiling live -- raising that ceiling was correct for every OTHER bucket (a broader, unfiltered
      page), but it makes THIS bucket's ordering claim less true, not more: sorting a 5000-issue
      page by priority ranks a P0 sitting at position 3000 first, while the live picker structurally
      cannot see past its own 200-issue window. Past that count, the order shown is only what the
      picker would serve for the first 200 it can reach.
    - `"board_ready_lane_authoritative"`: `GitHubSource.next_pending` calls `_board_queue()` FIRST
      and only falls through to the label-sorted path `_pick_key` implements when that returns
      `None` -- so on a Ready-lane-migrated board, `_pick_key`'s order is not merely an incomplete
      proxy for the real queue, it is order derived from an entirely different source than the one
      the picker will actually use. The marker is therefore structurally mandatory whenever it
      fires, not stylistic. Learned via `gh_source._ready_lane()` alone (the cheap, ≤2-call
      existence check) -- `_board_queue()` itself (paginated, measured 2.45s/268-item board in its
      own docstring) is deliberately never called here; this module's own docstring already commits
      buckets 2-8 to ONE shared fetch, and paying board-read cost on every survey would break that
      for the one bucket that happens to sit on a migrated repo.

    `_ready_lane()`'s failure path also has a user-visible side effect this bucket surfaces rather
    than leaving silent (F5): on a board-enabled repo whose runner lacks the `project` scope, it
    prints a warning to stderr once per process (`GitHubSource._note_scope`, which this module
    cannot suppress without editing sources.py) -- `"project_scope_missing"` mirrors that fact into
    `degraded` too, so a `--json` consumer of survey() learns the board read is blind on this run,
    not only a human watching stderr."""

    priority" for correctly-labelled issues, or silently pass ones that only carry the old default

    #1602: a missing `model:*` USED to be reported here too, and that was the bug. A hygiene item is
    a claim that an issue is not enqueue-ready, and priority earns it -- this module reads priority
    and orders waves by it. Nothing reads a `model:*` value: the enqueue path, the pick path and the
    tier prediction (`predict.py`, over the goal's TEXT, gated on `model_selection`) all behave
    identically with or without one, and `_ensure_labels` seeds no `model:*` label for an adopter to
    use. So the check demanded a label the kit defines nowhere, reads nowhere, and creates nowhere,

    audited board had invented `daily`, `sonnet` and `haiku`; this repo's had five values, agreeing

    try/excepted label calls (remove goal, remove in-progress, add parked); a transient failure on
    the first while the third still succeeds leaves exactly this contradiction, invisible until
    now because the missing-model/priority check above explicitly EXCLUDES parked issues from its
    own scope (`parked_l in names: continue`) -- a goal+parked issue was never even looked at.
    Detection only, deliberately (matches this whole module's own "NEVER writes" contract, see the

    `not_applicable_local_mode` -- as does `edges` (PR-review finding 3): `_local_goal_docs`'
    `ref` is a full FILE PATH, while `_BLOCK_RE` only ever captures a bare digit string after `#`,
    so `n not in open_refs` can never pass -- the bucket was structurally incapable of finding an
    edge while still reporting `degraded: []` (falsely healthy). Honest rather than clever: no
    numeric local-goal-id convention is established anywhere else in this codebase to build a real
    comparable ref on, so this reports absence rather than a heuristic that could itself mislead.

    `aliases` (#854 follow-up, independent-review finding): passed straight through to
    `discovery.priority_rank` for the enqueued case's sort key. Without it, a goal filed
    `priority: Critical` under a configured `priority_aliases` map sorted UNPRIORITISED here while
    `LocalSource.next_pending` (already alias-aware) would have picked it first -- survey and the
    live picker disagreeing about the same goal's urgency, the same two-places-drift shape #706's
    own docstring already names as the thing a lockstep test guards against.

    `order` (#706 §2a): the enqueued case's counterpart to `_bucket_enqueued`'s `gh_source._pick_key`
    -- `discovery.next_pending` inlines its sort into a single `min()` pass rather than exposing a
    separable key function the way `sources.GitHubSource._pick_key` does for github mode, so there
    is no bound method to reuse here; the `(priority_rank, ref)` tuple below reproduces it directly,
    a copy small enough that a lockstep test is the proportionate fix (see the module's own
    lockstep-pin table), not a `discovery.py` refactor #706 has no reason to make.

    `"priority"` on every emitted item (#839, independent-review finding on #714/PR #835): active/
    parked/enqueued items used to carry only `ref`/`title`/etc, never the goal's own `priority:`
    frontmatter value -- so `plan`'s own wave-ordering sort (`_priority_rank`, fed from a bucket
    item's "priority" field via `_survey_index`/`extra_index`) always saw `None` for a local-mode
    goal, regardless of its real tier, exactly the two-places-drift shape #706/#854 already fixed
    once for the ORDERING half of this same bucket. `docs[]` (built by `_local_goal_docs`, one
    screen up) already reads this value per-goal -- its own docstring documents it as read "the same
    way `discovery.priority_of` does" -- so this is `d["priority"]` reused as-is, not a second
    parse. Deliberately the RAW frontmatter value (`"P0"`, `"Critical"`, or `None`), never
    `discovery.priority_of`'s own return value: that function hands back an already-RANKED int
    (0-4, or `UNPRIORITISED`), and every consumer downstream of a bucket item's "priority" field
    (`_priority_rank`/`discovery.priority_rank`, both here and in every github-mode bucket) expects
    to rank a raw label itself -- handing it a pre-ranked int would silently misrank a P0 goal worst
    of all (`discovery.priority_rank(0)` reads as `UNPRIORITISED`: `str(0 or "")` is `""` via

    per-level caller, walking a whole chain one edge at a time exactly as that docstring's own "ONE
    LEVEL ONLY, BY DESIGN" section prescribes it must).

    TRANSITIVE, not just one hop (independent-review fix -- the original #900 landing computed each
    dependent's contribution from its RAW priority, so a chain of three or more issues only ever
    promoted the innermost link, exactly one level, no matter how urgent the far end was): for each
    direct dependent `d` (`_direct_dependents` above), `d`'s contribution is `d`'s own EFFECTIVE
    rank -- this same function, called recursively on `d` -- never `d`'s raw priority. That
    recursive call resolves `d` exactly the way `node` itself is being resolved: from `d`'s OWN
    direct dependents inward, so a chain C-blocks-B-blocks-A propagates A's urgency into B first,
    then feeds B's already-promoted (not original) rank into C, one edge at a time -- matching
    `discovery.blocker_promotion_rank`'s own documented contract and `sources.py`
    `GitHubSource._promote_blockers`'s own `resolve()` (a different file, read for reference, not
    touched here): the same memo/in-progress/cycle-guard shape, adapted to `schedule_waves`'s own
    remaining/ready state in place of a flat GitHub-issue ref dict.

    `memo` (node id -> resolved rank) and `in_progress` (a set of node ids currently mid-resolution)
    are shared across every node touched in ONE `schedule_waves` wave-iteration -- `schedule_waves`
    creates both fresh at the top of each `while remaining:` pass and threads them into every one of
    that wave's `_effective_rank` calls, so a node reachable from more than one path this wave (a
    diamond dependency, or two `ready` candidates that both transitively lead to the same downstream
    issue) is only ever actually resolved once; every later reference is an O(1) memo hit rather than
    a repeat walk. Both default to None so a caller that does not know about them (any caller written
    before this parameter existed, including every direct `_effective_rank` call this suite does not
    have -- it only ever drives this through `schedule_waves`) still gets fully correct results, just
    a fresh, call-scoped memo instead of a wave-shared one, exactly as if memoization did not exist.

    CYCLE GUARD, defensive: `node["id"]` is added to `in_progress` before recursing into its own
    dependents and discarded once resolved. If a recursive call is asked to resolve an id ALREADY in
    `in_progress` -- a back-edge, whether from a genuine "needs" cycle in the (hand-authored, so
    never fully trusted) blocking graph, or simply because `ready` always includes the very node
    still unwinding higher up this same call stack, so a has-other-work scan (below) can walk
    straight back into it -- that call does not re-enter: it returns the in_progress node's own RAW
    rank, the "no further promotion pressure from this edge" value, mirroring `sources.py`
    `resolve()`'s identical in-progress-set guard. `compile_plan` already runs `_cycles()` over
    `nodes` before ever calling `schedule_waves`, so a genuine cycle should never reach this function
    on that path -- but `schedule_waves` is also callable directly, bypassing that pre-check (several
    tests in this suite already do exactly this, for the stranded-node case below), so this guard
    does not assume the precondition holds; it is unconditional.

    For each direct dependent `d`, `d` "has other unblocked work at its own tier" when `ready` --
    excluding whichever node is CURRENTLY being resolved on this call (the immediate blocker `d` is
    being evaluated as a dependent of, at whatever recursion depth that is -- not necessarily the
    original top-level `node` this whole call started from) -- already holds some OTHER node ranked
    at `d`'s tier: promoting that blocker would not change what gets worked next for `d` regardless,
    since something else at that tier is already queued ahead of it either way. "smart" mode
    excludes such a `d` from consideration entirely (not merely caps its influence); "always"
    promotes on `d`'s account regardless. Both delegate the actual pool/min-selection to
    `blocker_promotion_rank` itself.

    RAW VS EFFECTIVE, decided (independent-review finding, explicitly left open by the fix's own
    brief -- documented here rather than left implicit, since the two now genuinely diverge once a
    dependent has itself been promoted): `d`'s "own tier" for THIS check is `d`'s EFFECTIVE rank --
    the exact same value just resolved above as `d`'s contribution to `blocker_promotion_rank`'s
    `dependent_rank` parameter -- never `d`'s raw priority. Reasoning: `blocker_promotion_rank`'s own
    docstring treats "`dependent_rank`" and "the dependent's own tier" as ONE concept, not two --
    feeding `d`'s raw priority into one and its effective rank into the other would silently split
    that single concept into two different numbers the moment `d` has itself been promoted by a
    deeper chain, which is exactly the scenario this fix exists to handle correctly; mixing them
    would undo the fix by a side door. And the mechanism's own stated purpose -- "would promoting
    this blocker actually change what gets worked next" -- is answered by whatever `schedule_waves`
    actually sorts `ready` by, which is EFFECTIVE rank; checking congestion at `d`'s stale raw tier
    would ask whether a tier `d` no longer really occupies is busy, the wrong question once `d` has
    been promoted elsewhere by its own downstream chain.
    The OTHER side of this same comparison -- the candidate nodes in `ready` being checked for
    occupancy at `d`'s tier -- deliberately STAYS raw, unchanged from before this fix. `ready` always
    includes whichever node is the ORIGINAL top-level call for this whole recursion (that is how it
    came to be in `ready` to begin with), so resolving every candidate's own effective rank here
    would walk this scan straight back into that still-in-progress node on EVERY has-other check, not
    merely on a genuine graph cycle -- silently trading an ordinary linear scan for one permanently
    leaning on the cycle guard's fallback rather than a real answer. Comparing against candidates'
    raw rank avoids that entirely, still answers the question this check needs answered (is some
    other already-known-urgent issue sitting at the tier `d` would compete at), and matches
    `sources.py`'s own reference shape, whose `pickable_by_rank` buckets candidates by raw rank only,
    never a resolved one.

    Deliberately recomputed fresh every wave (never cached across `schedule_waves` iterations, only
    within one): a dependent's own eligibility -- and even the SET of a node's direct dependents
    still outstanding -- changes as earlier waves complete, so a rank computed once at the top of the
    loop would go stale by the second iteration.

    The "off" (default) short-circuit happens BEFORE any dependent scan or memo/in_progress setup,
    not merely inside `blocker_promotion_rank` itself, mirroring that function's own "callers should
    typically skip calling this at all when mode is off" guidance -- so `plan`'s default, unqualified
    wave order pays no extra cost for a feature it never asked for."""

# this is the one exception, and it is deliberately never reached unless `--resolve-missing N` is
# passed explicitly. It lives here, not inside compile_plan -- `plan_cmd` calls it BEFORE compile_
# plan, and hands the result in as compile_plan's own `extra_index=` parameter, so the compiler
# itself never performs I/O regardless of whether this ran.


def _resolve_missing_picks(picked, survey_index, gh_source, run, limit):
    """{number: {"title","priority","model"}} for every PICKED issue absent from `survey_index`,
    ONE bounded `gh issue view` call each, up to `limit` total -- #713's opt-in index-lag fallback
    (`gh issue list`'s search-backed index is only eventually consistent; a just-labelled issue can
    be genuinely missing from a survey snapshot taken moments earlier).

    Bounded and targeted, never blind: only picks NOT already in `survey_index` are ever read, in
    `picked`'s own order (deterministic -- which picks get the limited budget when there are more
    misses than `limit` is never a set-iteration accident), and never more than `limit` of them
    regardless of how many are missing.

    Never raises: a single failed read (the issue genuinely does not exist, a transient network
    blip, `gh` unavailable) just leaves that ONE pick unresolved -- `compile_plan` already shows a
    bare "#N" for anything not in its merged index, exactly today's status quo, so a failure here
    costs nothing beyond "no better than before". Deliberately NOT retried the way the hot picker
    path (`_list_open_issues`/`_pending_by_label`) is: this is an explicit, already-bounded,
    best-effort top-up the caller chose to run, not the one read a whole loop tick depends on --
    adding backoff/retry here would only add latency to an opt-in convenience for marginal benefit,
    and the existing manual mitigation (re-run once the index has caught up) still works if it
    misses.

    `gh_source` supplies the configured `priority_label_prefix` (`gh_source is None` -- not
    constructed, e.g. non-github discovery mode -- falls back to the historical `"priority:"`,
    same contract every #706 bucket already uses) and, when present, scopes the read to its own

    happened by the time this is called; so has the optional live-read fallback below, if any --
    `extra_index` is a plain caller-supplied dict, never something this function fetches itself).

    `aliases` (#854 follow-up): passed straight through to `schedule_waves`. `compile_plan` is
    deliberately config-free (see above), so this is the caller's (`plan_cmd`'s) job to compute
    from config and hand in — omitted, a node's raw `priority` (which may itself be an unresolved
    alias spelling, e.g. `"critical"`, if it came from a github-mode label survey never ran through
    `discovery.priority_rank` before landing on the node) sorts last, unchanged from before this
    parameter existed.

    `blocker_promotion_mode` (#900): passed straight through to `schedule_waves`, same config-free
    posture as `aliases` above -- `plan_cmd` resolves it from `discovery.blocker_promotion.mode` via
    `sources._blocker_promotion(config)` and hands it in here. Omitted (the default, "off"), wave
    order is exactly what `schedule_waves` produced before this parameter existed.
    Validates, IN ORDER (an earlier check can never be masked by a later one): self-edge ->
    blocked-not-picked -> defer/pick overlap -> cycle -> schedule. Every validation failure is a
    ValueError naming the exact bad value. A cyclic graph is instead reported as DATA
    (`result["cycle_error"]`, empty waves) -- mirrors `slices.py` `main()`'s own "problems ->
    return before ever calling schedule()" ordering: a cyclic INPUT is a legitimate finding about
    the graph's SHAPE, not a malformed-argument mistake the way self-edge/blocked-not-picked/
    defer-overlap are, so the caller (`plan_cmd`) reports it differently (exit 1, not 2) even
    though both paths write nothing.

    `extra_index` (#713): an optional {number: {"title","priority","model"}} dict -- `plan_cmd`'s
    own opt-in `--resolve-missing` fallback, computed BEFORE this call for picks the survey index
    doesn't cover. Merged UNDER the survey-derived index (survey wins on any overlap, though
    `plan_cmd`'s own construction never produces one by design -- extra_index only ever contains
    picks already confirmed absent from the survey). This keeps `compile_plan` itself exactly as
    pure as it was before #713: whether or not a live read happened is entirely the caller's
    business, this function only ever merges two already-in-memory dicts.

    `now` is the one ambient-clock reading in this whole compiler: `generated_at` is embedded in
    the result so `render_json`/`render_active` (via `plan_cmd`) read ONE single timestamp, never

    skipped when already satisfied, so the returned list holds only the GAPS -- what makes
    "idempotent: second apply = zero actions" literal, not merely low-count.

    "Unpark v1-lite" is not a separate branch: per the label model (a PARK drops `goal_label` and
