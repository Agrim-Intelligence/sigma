"""#1129/#1394: the reconciliation sweep for `sdlc:blocked` GitHub issues whose recorded
`blocked by #N` targets have all closed. ON by default since #1394 (`sources.DEFAULT_AUTO_UNPARK_MODE`),
which is also when it stopped resuming `sdlc:parked` issues -- a park is a human's (see
`compute_unpark_actions`). The history below describes the #1129 design it grew from.

The bug this fixes: `next()`/`next-batch` only ever pick issues carrying `sdlc:goal`. Parking on a
`blocked-by` finding (`backlog_check.decide()` -> `loop.py`'s `precheck`) removes `sdlc:goal` and
adds `sdlc:parked` -- the goal permanently exits the picker's candidate pool. `backlog_check.
_explicit_blockers` already correctly re-derives blocker freshness on every call (a ref only counts
as blocking if it's STILL OPEN) -- so IF a parked goal were ever re-examined, it would correctly see
a closed blocker as no longer blocking. But nothing ever re-examines one automatically: the only
code path that undoes a park (drop `sdlc:parked`, re-add `sdlc:goal`) is `triage.py`'s `enact`, the
third stage of a human-driven `survey` -> `plan --pick` -> `enact --apply` campaign, which the
autonomous loop never invokes.

This module glues two already-correct, already-existing pieces together -- no new machinery:
`backlog_check._explicit_blockers`'s own freshness re-check, and `triage.py`'s existing "v1-lite
unpark" action pair (add `sdlc:goal`, drop `sdlc:parked`) via `triage.apply_actions`/
`_execute_action`, reused live, not reimplemented.

Deliberately narrow, on purpose: a parked issue with NO machine-detectable "blocked by #N"
reference anywhere in its own title+body or comments is left completely untouched, whatever else
it was parked for (duplicate / obsoleted-by / needs_decision / a human's own manual "on purpose"
park, e.g. a deliberate sequencing checkpoint) -- this sweep only ever reverses the ONE park class
it can prove is stale, never guesses at any other. A parked issue referencing MULTIPLE blockers is
swept only once every one of them has closed.

#1186 FIX: the safety claim above used to be defeated by this module's OWN park comment. Every park
Sigma ever posts (`sources.park`/`fail`, via `_offboard`) opens with a fixed prefix --
`sources.PARK_COMMENT_PREFIX` ("Parked by Sigma — needs human review: "), and the sibling
`FAIL_COMMENT_PREFIX` -- and the word "needs" in that fixed prose is ITSELF a `_BLOCK_RE` trigger.
Left unfiltered, any `#N` the CALLER's own free-text `reason` happened to mention within the
match window read as a phantom "machine-detectable blocker reference" that had nothing to do with
a real dependency -- so a `needs_decision` park recording "PR #1234 is not approved yet" (say) was
never actually the "no machine-detectable reference" case the paragraph above promises; it silently
WAS one, on the strength of Sigma's own boilerplate. `backlog_check._strip_offboard_prefixes`
now strips exactly that fixed prefix span (never the reason that follows it) before ANY
`_BLOCK_RE`/`_referenced_blocker_refs` scan sees the text -- restoring the paragraph above to
actually true, not just not-yet-proven-false. This is a SEPARATE filter from `_is_exempt`/
`KEEP_PARKED_MARKER` below: that one is an opt-out a human deliberately posts; this one is
structural, unconditional, and needs no opt-in or human action at all.

Config: `discovery.auto_unpark.mode` -- 'on' (default since #1394) | 'off'. See `sources._auto_unpark`. GitHub
mode only, the identical reach `discovery.blocker_promotion` (#900) already has, and for the
identical reason: a local goal's own "blocked by #N" reference is a file path, never a bare issue
number `_BLOCK_RE` can match, so `LocalSource` has nothing to ever sweep.

`sweep_unpark()` itself is UNGATED -- it always computes and (optionally) applies, exactly like
`triage.enact()` is unconditional once invoked. The `discovery.auto_unpark.mode` config gate lives
solely at the one call site that runs with nobody asking for it THIS run (`loop.py`'s `_next()`,
see `_auto_unpark_sweep` there) -- a direct call here (this module's own CLI, or a supervising
cron) is itself the opt-in, the same posture `triage.py enact --apply` already has with no separate
config flag of its own.

Post-#1129-review cooldown (`result["unparked"]`): this sweep decides on TEXTUAL SHAPE alone (a
`blocked by #N` phrase + the `sdlc:parked` label) -- it has no way to tell a genuinely-stale block
apart from a human's deliberate "on purpose" checkpoint that happens to share that same shape,
since intent isn't something either can express through it. `sweep_unpark()`'s result therefore
names exactly which issues it actually flipped `sdlc:parked` -> `sdlc:goal` THIS pass
(`result["unparked"]`, apply-mode only -- a dry-run mutates nothing, so it is always `[]` there),
so `loop.py`'s `_next()` can hold that SPECIFIC goal back from its own SAME-call pick (see
`_next()`'s own docstring) -- a real window for a human to read the audit comment and re-park it
before autonomous work resumes, not just an after-the-fact notice. That window is a mitigation for
a block this sweep could not have known was deliberate ahead of time -- it is not detection.

#1152 adds actual detection for the case where a human already KNOWS a specific park is deliberate:
`KEEP_PARKED_MARKER` (below), an HTML-comment marker posted as a COMMENT on the goal issue --
mirrors #830's `DISMISS_MARKER` convention in `backlog_check.py` exactly (a comment, never a body
rewrite; see that marker's own design-rationale comment for why). A goal carrying it is skipped by
`compute_unpark_actions` before ANY `_BLOCK_RE`/`_referenced_blocker_refs` scan runs at all, on
every call regardless of `discovery.auto_unpark.mode` -- not a post-hoc filter over an already-
computed finding, so no phrase-detection quirk in the park text can ever defeat an opt-out a human
already recorded. See the README's `auto_unpark` section for the adopter-facing walkthrough of both
mechanisms together.

    #1358 (against #1350's own gap): `mark_blocked` (#1350) transitions an in-progress goal
    straight to `goal_blocked_label` (default `sdlc:blocked`) -- a DISTINCT state from
    `parked_label` (`_offboard`'s own `already_blocked` guard exists specifically so the two never
    coexist on one issue, see `mark_blocked`'s docstring). Before this, a goal that landed in
    `sdlc:blocked` had no discovery path anywhere in this sweep -- it could never be found here,
    and so could never auto-resume even after its blocker closed, unlike the pre-#1350 equivalent
    (a plain `sdlc:parked` issue, which this sweep has always found). Two separate `--label`
    queries, not one `--search "label:A,B"` OR query: `gh issue list --label` ANDs repeated flags
    together (requires ALL named labels present), so an OR needs either two calls or raw search
    syntax -- two calls keeps this module's existing `_repo_args()`/`--json`/`--limit` shape
    identical for both, at the cost of one more list call on every sweep pass (page-list calls are
    the cheap half of this module's own cost accounting; the `issue view`/comment calls inside
    `compute_unpark_actions` below dominate whenever anything is actually found).

    Deduped by `number` even though the two labels are meant to be mutually exclusive on any one
    issue today (see above) -- a hand-fed fixture, or a future label-model change, returning the
    same issue for both queries must never be double-counted into `compute_unpark_actions`.

    Thin wrapper over `_fetch_parked_issues_status` (below) that drops the completeness flag --
    every EXISTING caller of this name only ever wanted the issues (partial data is the safe
    direction for `compute_unpark_actions`: a missed parked issue is just fewer unparks this pass,
    caught next time). `sweep_unpark` is the one caller that cannot afford that same assumption for

def compute_blocking_actions(sdlc_dir, config, source, blocked_issues, currently_blocking, run=None,

    """#1351: `sdlc:blocking` — derived, self-healing, applied to the BLOCKER issue itself (not the
    blocked goal `compute_unpark_actions` above manages). `blocked_issues` is the SAME list
    `_fetch_parked_issues` already returned for this pass (no second fetch); `currently_blocking` is
    `_fetch_blocking_issues`'s own "before" snapshot. `open_cache`: see `compute_unpark_actions`'s
    own doc for this shared-memo param -- `None` (the default) makes a fresh dict, unchanged prior
    behaviour.

    For each blocked/parked issue, reuses the EXACT same detection pipeline `compute_unpark_actions`
    does — `_referenced_blocker_refs` (the superset, any state) narrowed by a fresh
    `_explicit_blockers` re-check (still-open only) — never new regex/detection logic (#1186's own
    lesson: Sigma's own park-comment boilerplate can itself trigger a naive scan).

    Deliberately does NOT skip `_is_exempt` issues the way `compute_unpark_actions` does (#1351
    review finding, notable-severity correctness bug in the original version, which did skip them):
    `KEEP_PARKED_MARKER` opts a goal OUT OF AUTO-UNPARK ELIGIBILITY -- a human's "this park is a
    deliberate checkpoint" -- it says nothing about whether the blocker the goal's own text still
    names should keep reading as "something depends on you". Skipping exempt issues here meant an
    exempt goal's live "Blocked by #N" reference contributed nothing to `live_blocker_refs`, so a
    blocker already correctly labeled `sdlc:blocking` on the strength of that exact reference got
    wrongly stripped the very next sweep, even though the exempt issue was still open and still
    naming it. `_is_exempt`/`KEEP_PARKED_MARKER` remain relevant ONLY to `compute_unpark_actions`'s
    own re-add decision above, not to this function's bookkeeping.
    Deliberately a SEPARATE pass over the same `blocked_issues` rather than merged into
    `compute_unpark_actions` above: the two need different signals from the identical scan (that
    function wants "are ALL refs closed"; this one wants "which SPECIFIC refs are still open"), and
    keeping them independent avoids entangling two already-subtle pieces of logic into one harder-to-
    verify function, at the cost of one extra `gh issue view`/comment fetch per issue per sweep pass
    — cheap relative to the correctness risk of merging them.

    RETROACTIVE, for free: `blocked_issues` already includes issues carrying the OLD, generic
    `parked_label` (see `_fetch_parked_issues`), not just the new `goal_blocked_label` — an issue
    filed before this epic shipped, still generically `sdlc:parked` but still naming a live open
    blocker, gets that blocker labeled `sdlc:blocking` exactly the same way a fresh `sdlc:blocked`
    issue would. No separate migration pass needed.

    MULTI-BLOCKER, correctly: a blocker referenced by more than one open issue stays in the live set
    (and therefore keeps `sdlc:blocking`) until ALL referencing issues' scans stop finding it —
    `live_blocker_refs` is a plain union across EVERY issue in `blocked_issues`, exempt or not (see
    the exemption note above).

    Add-only-what's-missing / remove-only-what's-stale, exactly like `compute_unpark_actions`'s own
    action shape: `to_add = live_blocker_refs - currently_blocking`,
    `to_remove = currently_blocking - live_blocker_refs`."""

    """The whole sweep pass -- `triage.enact()`'s own shape (`sdlc_dir, config, ..., apply=False,
    run=None` -> a result dict; dry-run computes and reports, never writes). UNGATED: see this
    module's own docstring for why the `discovery.auto_unpark.mode` config check is the CALLER's
    job, not this function's. Defends its own reach regardless of caller, though: a no-op outside
    GitHub mode (`mirror.is_github_mode`), the same guard `backlog_check._fetch_scrubbed_comments`
    already applies for the identical reason.

    `apply=True`: labels are mutated through `triage.apply_actions`/`_execute_action` -- the exact
    primitive `enact --apply`'s own unpark case already uses, not a reimplementation -- then, for
    every issue whose actions ALL landed (`done`, never `failed`), one audit-trail comment naming
    the closed blocker(s) (`_UNPARK_COMMENT`). `discovery.blocker_promotion`'s own README section
    states its rule plainly -- "every promotion is paired with an explanatory comment... never a
    silent label change" -- and an UNATTENDED write needs that even more than a human-reviewed
    `enact --apply` does (a human who just built the plan already has full context; nobody is
    watching this sweep run). Best-effort: a comment failure never flips an already-successful
    label edit back to reporting failure, and never retries.

    `result["unparked"]`: the SAME "all landed" issue numbers named above, independent of whether
    their audit comment itself succeeded (best-effort, per above) -- a sorted list, `[]` whenever
    `apply` is false (a dry-run mutates nothing, so nothing was really unparked yet). This is the
    cooldown hook: `loop.py`'s `_auto_unpark_sweep`/`_next()` read it to keep the very goal this
    call just unparked from ALSO being the one this same call's own pick returns -- see this
    module's own docstring and `_next()`'s for the full mechanism.

    #1351 review findings (two, both fixed here):

    BLOCKING -- the `sdlc:blocking` reconciliation only runs when `_fetch_parked_issues_status`
    reports `complete` (both label queries succeeded): a wrongly-EMPTY `issues` list from a
    transient outage would otherwise make `compute_blocking_actions` conclude nothing is blocked
    and strip every currently-correct `sdlc:blocking` label -- a destructive write from nothing more
    than a network blip. It also runs inside its own `try/except`, isolated from the unpark
    computation above it: a raise inside the newer, less-proven blocking code must cost only this
    one reconciliation pass, never silently discard the unrelated, already-computed unpark actions
    -- the fail-open guarantee this module's other primitives already give.

    NOTABLE -- the unpark audit-comment/cooldown check below (`resolved`'s "did ALL of this issue's
    actions land" test) is computed from `unpark_results` ONLY, never the combined `actions` list.
    A blocker issue can itself be independently eligible to unpark in the SAME pass (an overlapping
    issue-number topology: #7 is a parked goal AND is #42's live blocker), and an unrelated failure
    on #7's `sdlc:blocking` edit must never mask #7's own, fully-successful unpark -- checking
    against the combined list would count #7 as "not fully landed" and silently drop its audit
    comment and cooldown entry over an action that was never part of the unpark decision at all."""
