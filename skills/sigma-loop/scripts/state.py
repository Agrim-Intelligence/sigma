    `.sdlc/state/` is gitignored by design (it is per-machine runtime), so a teammate who CLONES an
    adopted repo has the committed config and goals but no state files at all — and every entry point
    here used to die on a raw FileNotFoundError before their first goal. Scaffolding on demand costs
    nothing and is the difference between `/sigma-loop` working on a fresh clone and not; since #550
    that scaffold happens only on the LOCKED write path, and `load_cursor` reads the template's own
    defaults instead (see below).

    Exclusive-create (`O_CREAT | O_EXCL`), never a plain `if not exists: write_text(...)` (#531):
    the old check-then-write had its own unlocked TOCTOU gap — this function used to be reachable
    from `load_cursor`, deliberately lock-free, so a lock-free reader could see "not exists", lose a race
    to a locked `add_tokens` that creates AND writes a real value in between, then still go ahead and
    OVERWRITE that value with the blank template (reproduced: a locked writer publishes `run_tokens:
    7`, then this function's old body clobbers it back to the template). `O_EXCL` makes "already
    exists" a clean, atomic `FileExistsError` instead of a race to inspect-then-act — the losing side
    just walks away instead of clobbering the winner.

    ONLY LOCKED CALLERS MAY REACH THIS (#550). `load_cursor` used to call it too, and a scaffold on
    the lock-free read path is by definition an unlocked creator racing the locked writers: the
    reader could win the `O_EXCL` create, still be mid-template-write when a locked `add_tokens` got
    `FileExistsError`, read the empty file and publish a cursor built from nothing. The exclusive
    create bounded that to the first creation and kept it counter-lossless, but did not remove it.
    Publishing the template through `mkstemp` + `os.replace` inside the `else` branch does not fix
    it either — measured, it makes it WORSE: the reader's atomic replace of a blank template then
    lands AFTER the writer's publish and destroys a real counter value (0/5 losses before, 5/5
    after). The fix is to have no unlocked creator at all, so `load_cursor` now reads the template's
    defaults for an absent file instead of creating one.

    Mode 0o644 explicitly: `os.open` with no mode argument defaults to 0o777, so a scaffolded
    STATE.md landed executable (0o755 under a normal umask) until some later publish happened to

    """Serializes every STATE.md cursor writer (`_patch_cursor`, and therefore `add_tokens` /
    `start_run` / `advance_cursor`) across processes AND threads, with the same kernel-mediated
    `fcntl.flock` primitive that closed the identical unlocked-RMW race in `_try_acquire_claim_lock`
    (loop.py, #387) — flock is atomic at the kernel level, so there is no read-then-act gap of its
    own for a second writer to land in.

    Locks a SIBLING file, `state/STATE.md.lock` — never STATE.md itself. `_patch_cursor` publishes
    via `os.replace`, which swaps the directory entry onto a NEW inode; a writer that flocked the OLD
    inode (opened before the replace) would be locking a file nothing points at anymore, so a lock ON
    STATE.md itself would stop actually excluding anyone the moment the first publish happens. A
    separate, never-replaced lock file has no such lifetime problem.

    BLOCKING (`LOCK_EX`, not `LOCK_NB`): unlike the claim lock (where "someone else already owns
    this goal" is a normal, expected outcome to skip past), the only writers ever contending here are
    cooperating cursor updates that both need to land — cursor writes are milliseconds, and silently
    SKIPPING a budget update is the very bug this closes. There is deliberately no timeout: the
    critical section (`_patch_cursor`'s read + the caller's `patch()` + temp-write + `os.replace`) is
    pure, fast, local file I/O with nothing in it that can hang — the caller-supplied `patch`
    callable must never do I/O of its own beyond computing from the text it is given, or that
    contract breaks.

    No fsync before `os.replace`: a torn publish is impossible either way (replace is atomic), the
    worst a same-instant power loss can do is lose the last write entirely and leave the PREVIOUS
    good file in place — an accepted trade-off already made the same way by `actionlog.py` and
    `work.py`'s own publish paths in this repo. `os.replace` overwrites unconditionally on Windows
    too (unlike bare `os.rename`), so the atomic-publish half of this fix needs no Windows-specific
    branch — only the locking half does.

    Fail-open, exactly mirroring `_try_acquire_claim_lock`'s documented reasoning: yields WITHOUT the
    lock when `fcntl` doesn't exist (Windows), when the lock file can't even be opened, or on any
    other OSError acquiring the flock (e.g. `ENOLCK` on a lock-less NFS mount) — a lock this call
    cannot manage must never be what stops the loop. Crash-release is free: the kernel drops the

    content from the text read UNDER THE LOCK — never from a caller's own separately-read, possibly
    stale text — so two concurrent callers never overwrite each other's increment.

    Publishes via a `tempfile.mkstemp` temp file in the SAME directory (so `os.replace` stays on one
    filesystem, the only case it's atomic), then `os.replace` onto STATE.md — a lock-free reader
    (`load_cursor` is deliberately lock-free, see its own docstring) therefore only ever observes the

    each publish through their OWN temp file, never a shared one — no worse than today's
    last-writer-wins.

    severity at a glance without opening the goal.

    Exclusive-create, for the same reason `_state_file` uses it (#550 — this was the sibling that
    PR's scope left open): `if not q.exists(): q.write_text(TEMPLATE)` is check-then-act, and
    `write_text` TRUNCATES. Two first-parks on a fresh clone — two `parallel.goals` worktree
    siblings, say — can both see "not exists", and the loser's template write then destroys whatever
    the winner already appended. `O_EXCL` makes "someone else got here first" a clean
    `FileExistsError` to walk away from instead of a race to inspect-then-act. Mode 0o644 because
    `os.open` otherwise defaults to 0o777 (an executable markdown file).

    The append itself needs no locking and gets none: `O_APPEND` writes from independent file
    descriptions are atomic at the OS level, so concurrent entries interleave whole, never torn.
    Only the scaffold step was ever racy.

    The scaffold fd carries `O_APPEND` too, which is load-bearing rather than tidy: exclusive-create
    alone still leaves a residual of the very bug this fixes. The winner creates an EMPTY file and
    is not yet holding a position at EOF, so a loser that appends its entry in the gap before the
    template write has that entry overwritten from offset 0 (measured: 2 losses in 8 runs of the
    8-process test below). `O_APPEND` forces the template to EOF instead, so nothing can be

    (independent review of #486/PR #487): `loop.py::agent_end()`'s unconditional, ungated
    `shutil.rmtree()` on an unvalidated goal-derived path (reachable from the everyday `record`

    `loop.py::_claim_lock_path()` / `work.py::record_path()` all shared the identical gap.

    `goal` reaches every one of these from either an LLM/agent-typed CLI argument or (rarely) a
    malformed local `.sdlc/goals/*.md` filename — untrusted in both cases, exactly like `thread`.
    pathlib's own `/` join operator RE-PARSES a string argument for separator characters, so a `/`
    or `\\` inside `stem` does not stay one filename, it becomes ADDITIONAL path segments, one of
    which can be a literal `..` — escaping the intended `state/...` subtree entirely (confirmed by

    """#889: a stable run id derived from a session's own pid, or None when there isn't a usable
    one. The bare-`/sigma-loop` counterpart to `supervise_daemon.py`'s own run-id.

    WHY THIS EXISTS. `run_identity()` below reads `SIGMA_RUN_ID`, and `supervise_daemon.py` is
    its only source — so an interactive `/sigma-loop` was always unattributed, and
    `_emit_run_stop_once`'s attribution gate (loop.py) skipped every terminal event it ever
    reached. Measured cost: 0 `kind='run_stop'` rows across 1,081 real ledger event files, which
    is why a downstream budget-exhaustion rate rendered as an empty view.

    WHY A PID AND NOT A FRESH RANDOM. There is no long-lived shell to export into: every
    `python3 loop.py ...` in an interactive session is a new process, so a minted-per-invocation
    id would be UNSTABLE, and unstable is strictly worse than None on all three consumers —
    `claim_run_stop` is keyed `(run_id, run_started_at)`, so each idle `next` poll would claim a
    fresh slot and emit a DUPLICATE run_stop (the exact bug #905 closed); `done_refusal` would see
    a different id at verify than at record; and the `claimed`/terminal events would each carry a
    one-shot id nothing could correlate. The caller's own session pid is the one axis that is
    stable across a session's invocations AND distinct between concurrent sessions.

    CALLERS MUST PASS THE EXPLICIT `--session-pid`, never `os.getppid()`. Measured 2026-08-22
    across two separate tool-style calls: `$$` differed (74411, 74415) while `$PPID` was 31857
    both times. `os.getppid()` measured from inside `loop.py` is that transient `$$`-level parent
    (loop.py's own `session_start` docstring establishes the distinction), so deriving from it
    would reintroduce exactly the instability the paragraph above rules out. `loop.py:2606`'s
    `session_pid = os.getppid()` fallback is therefore NOT a valid input here — read the flag
    before that fallback runs.

    Returns None for anything that isn't a positive integer, including the literal "true" a

    Keyed on the PAIR, not the bare `run_id` alone (plan-review's own Defect 1): `run_id` is stable
    across one `supervise_daemon.py` worker's ENTIRE lifetime, including every budget-stop-then-relaunch
    cycle (`supervise_daemon.py` itself: "budget -> short pause + relaunch"; `supervise_classify.py`:
    "budgets reset on relaunch by design") — a bare-id marker would record only the FIRST terminal
    event ever reached under that id and silently drop every later, genuinely different one (e.g.
    the real eventual backlog-empty after two budget stops). `run_started_at` (from
    `load_cursor(sdlc_dir)["run_started_at"]`) is written fresh by `start_run` at the top of every
    `/sigma-loop` invocation, including every relaunch, so a relaunch's own terminal event claims
    independently while repeated polling WITHIN one unchanged drain (the original concern in #905's
    own issue body — "the polled 'next' verb... would emit a duplicate... on every idle poll")
    still dedupes against the same marker file.

    Storing the claimed set (not a bare boolean) keeps this correct across however many distinct
    `run_started_at` values one run id accumulates over its life, without ever needing to reset or
    expire the marker: a fresh `supervise_daemon.py` invocation always mints a fresh `run_id`
    (`supervise-<pid>-<timestamp>-<random>`), so a stale marker for a dead id is inert, harmless
    clutter, never consulted again — no TTL/cleanup needed for correctness.

    Fail-open, like every write this deep in `_next()`'s own call graph (`ledger.safe_append`,
    `_release_claim_lock`): a read/write failure here must never raise into `_next()`'s caller — the
    loop's single most frequently-invoked verb — so it returns `False` ("not yet claimed") on ANY
    failure reading/writing the marker (missing file, malformed or unexpectedly-shaped JSON,
    permissions, disk full) — deliberately broad, not just the I/O-error subset, because a
    journal marker must never be the reason `_next()` crashes.

    PR-review correction: `False` here makes the CALLER (`_emit_run_stop_once`) skip the ledger
    write too, not "attempt it anyway" — an earlier revision of this docstring claimed the
    opposite. Skipping is the deliberately safer choice: under a SUSTAINED fault (e.g. a
    permanently unwritable `.sdlc/state/run_stop/`), every claim attempt would keep returning
    `False` forever, so "attempt the write regardless of the claim" would reopen the exact
    duplicate-emit-on-every-poll problem this dedupe exists to close, just routed around a broken
    marker instead of through a working one. A lost dedupe row's WRITE, not just its claim, is the
    accepted cost — never a crash, and never an unbounded flood of duplicate rows either."""

    """WHAT a verify actually ran against: this goal's own change at `root`, as a digest.

    -> `{"fingerprint": <hex>|None, "base_ref": ..., "files": {path: entry}|None, "detail": None|why}`
    Never raises. THREE outcomes, and collapsing any two of them is a bug:
      * `files` is a NON-EMPTY dict  -> measured, and `fingerprint` is its digest.
      * `files == {}`                -> measured, and there is nothing to compare (see LANDED below).
        `fingerprint` is None, deliberately — hashing the empty map yields `sha256("")`, a TRUTHY
        digest that would then mismatch every recorded one.
      * `files is None`              -> could NOT measure (no fork point, no git, no checkout).

    WHY NOT THE OBVIOUS THINGS. `head` (already in the evidence since #1985) cannot be it: SKILL.md's
    order is verify -> commit -> pr -> review -> merge -> record done, so at verify time the whole
    change is UNCOMMITTED and `head` is just the shared base — measured on this repo, goals
    1933/1934/1935/1936/1937/1962 all recorded the SAME `head`. Comparing it after `work.py commit`
    moved HEAD would refuse every goal ever. A whole-tree hash (`GIT_INDEX_FILE` + `write-tree`) is
    wrong for a different reason: it moves on every rebase, costs O(repo), and writes loose objects
    into the operator's repo from inside a read-only gate.

    So the unit is THE GOAL'S OWN CHANGE, relative to `merge-base(HEAD, <remote>/<base>)`. That one
    formulation survives all three mutations the documented flow performs between a green verify and
    `record done` — `git commit` (content unchanged), a bare `git fetch` (the fork point is the old
    one either way, and linked worktrees SHARE `refs/remotes/*`, so a sibling slot's fetch must not
    move it), and a clean rebase (the fork point becomes the new base and the replayed diff is the
    same) — while still moving on any edit, deletion, mode flip or retargeted symlink.

    THE PATH SET IS EXACTLY WHAT THE PR WILL CARRY: `git diff <fork>` (tracked changes, measured
    against the WORKING TREE, so uncommitted work counts) plus `git ls-files --others
    --exclude-standard` (the goal's new files, not yet tracked). That union is what `work.py
    commit`'s own `git add -A` stages, which is what makes a new file hash identically before and
    after it is committed. `--no-renames` so a rename reads as delete+add rather than one path.

    `bookkeeping` (Sigma's own `.sdlc` directory name) is DROPPED from that set, and the reason
    is a live defect this guard's own plan-review caught before it shipped: SKILL.md step 6 copies
    `<sdlc>/plans/<stem>.md` INTO the worktree after verify and before `commit` (`work.py pr`
    refuses to push without it), and `sigma-setup`'s `RUNTIME_IGNORES` covers `state/ ledger/ work/
    knowledge/ events/` and pointedly NOT `plans/`. On an adopter repo that file is
    untracked-and-not-ignored, so counting it refused EVERY goal on the documented path. This repo's
    own `.gitignore` (`.sdlc/*`) hid it — which is exactly why the control for it runs against a
    repo with no `.gitignore` at all. Nothing under the loop's own bookkeeping directory is ever
    what the proving command proved.

    LANDED IS NOT TAMPERED. Once the goal's commits are ancestors of its base, `merge-base` IS HEAD
    and the change measures empty. Two proven routes: with `merge_method: merge` any fetch (a
    sibling worktree's included) does it, and with `squash` any rebase after the land does
    (`skippedCherryPicks`). The caller must read `{}` as "nothing left to compare", never as a
    mismatch — `done_refusal` does.

    COST is the goal's own diff, not the repo: four short git reads plus one `sha256` per changed
    path. MEASURED by calling this function on this repo (2026-09-02, warm cache, one sample each):
    5 changed paths 37.7 ms · 167 paths / 7.1 MB 63.1 ms · 730 paths / 19.4 MB 133.6 ms. So it is
    ~37 ms of fixed cost (the four subprocess spawns) plus ~0.13 ms per changed path — 10x the
    change is well under 2x the call, and 100x the REPO is free, because the repo is never walked.
    The `files` map is the storage term and grows with the same 10x: 0.6 KB of evidence for an
    ordinary goal, 79.8 KB for that 730-path one, into `state/verify/` which nothing prunes (a
    pre-existing bound, not one this adds). Nothing is written to git — no index, no objects, no
    locks: `merge-base`, `diff --name-only`, `ls-files` and `rev-parse` are all reads."""

    rewrites files, and `rebase()`'s CHANGELOG union-merge rescue rewrites CHANGELOG.md
    DETERMINISTICALLY -- its own docstring calls that "the single most frequent conflict in this
    repo". So the fingerprint moved after the gate passed and before `record done` ran, and
    `record done` exited 4 on a PR that had ALREADY merged: the content shipped and only the
    bookkeeping broke, which is the worst of the two directions. Found in review of #1897/PR #2056.

    verify command is declared for the goal (there is something to run, so a merge without having
    run it is a merge nobody verified -- the pre-#312 merge contract, unchanged). Neither -> None:

    park every merge forever on a condition no gesture can satisfy -- the defect #312 found on the
    documented "decline the verify command" path.

    Readers: `work.merge` gates on this whole rule. `loop.py record done` gates on its `enforce`
    half only (`enforce_enabled`), as it always has -- with `work.enabled` and a PR, `record done`
    additionally requires the PR MERGED, and the merge already passed this rule, so the command
