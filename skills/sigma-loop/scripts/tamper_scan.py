"""Diff-only test-tamper detection (issue #1937) -- the layer that guards the suite that ALREADY
existed.

Every other test-trust layer guards the NEW test: red-before-green records it, the mutation gate
scores it, the author-blind breaker writes it. None of them looks at the tests that were already
passing. That is the open door: an agent that cannot make the implementation satisfy the old test
can simply edit the old test, and every red-first record and mutation score for the NEW code stays
green while the regression protection that was there before is quietly gone. The signal is the
ABSENCE of something that used to be there, which is exactly the shape of defect this repo has been
bitten by before (a squash template dropping `(#N)` makes every landed commit unaccountable and
nothing announces it).

NO TEST EXECUTION, NO GIT, NO FILESYSTEM. `scan()` takes unified-diff TEXT and returns counts. That
is a deliberate decomposition, not an accident of implementation: it means the caller supplies the
one input every context already has (a gate, a hook, a CI step, a human with `git diff` in a
terminal), and it means every control in tests/test_test_trust.py is a string fixture rather than a
scratch repo.

WHY TEXT RATHER THAN AN AST OF BOTH REVISIONS. Parsing the old and new blobs with `ast` would be
more precise about "weakened", but it needs both revisions checked out and cannot run on a diff
alone. The precision that trades away is named below rather than hidden.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT CATCH, stated plainly because a guard that oversells itself is worse than none:
  - a tolerance widened inside a helper the test calls, rather than in the test body;
  - an assertion moved into a branch that never executes (an `if False:`, an unreachable `else`);
  - a test whose FIXTURE is weakened -- a narrower input, a stubbed collaborator -- while its
    assertions are untouched. This is probably the largest hole and it is not addressable by any
    line-level pass;
  - a `-` line inside a docstring or a string literal that merely looks like an `assert`;
  - a parametrised case removed from a `@pytest.mark.parametrize` list, which deletes real coverage
    without touching a single `assert` line.
It is a cheap, high-signal pass over the commonest deliberate weakenings, not a proof of
non-tampering.
