"""A parsed, code-enforced permission marker for the loop's "park on an irreversible or expensive
action" rule (#722, Part 1). Zero LLM, zero spend, stdlib only.

THE PROBLEM. `skills/sigma-loop/SKILL.md` tells every agent the loop runs to park on "an irreversible
or expensive action (deploy, delete, overwrite, spend, migrate) -- NEVER run one unattended". That
decision is made by the AGENT, from prose. The only code that touches it is `loop._reason_class`,
which labels the park reason AFTER the agent already parked. So an operator's explicit written
"yes, run the paid job" was one more sentence for the agent to weigh against a NEVER, and the NEVER
won, every time. There was no marker, label or key that exempted a goal.

THE MECHANISM. `loop.py spend-approval <dir> <goal> --action "<what>"` is the ONE gesture the SKILL
now tells an agent to run before it parks on that rule. It answers, in code and in the same words on
every host: `APPROVED <label>` (exit 0), `DENIED <reason>` (exit 3) or `OFF` (exit 4). The first
word is the whole machine contract; anything after it is for the human.

WHAT MAKES IT AN EXEMPTION RATHER THAN A SUGGESTION. Each of these is a fail-CLOSED guard, and the
default for every unreadable, malformed or ambiguous input is DENIED -- park, exactly as today:

  * OPT-IN. `spend_approval.enabled` must be exactly `True` (not "true", not 1). Off by default.
  * WHO. The issue's AUTHOR must be one of `spend_approval.approvers` (case-insensitive logins) AND
    GitHub must report the author's association as one of `sources.TRUSTED_ASSOCIATIONS` (OWNER,
    MEMBER, COLLABORATOR); an absent or unknown association is DENIED. An empty or malformed approver
    list means nobody can authorise anything. This is what stops an issue filed by a bot or a
    third party from granting itself the exemption.
  * WHERE. The marker is honoured on the FIRST LINE of the issue BODY only -- never in a comment,
    never later in the body -- mirroring `design_goal.DESIGN_OF_MARKER`'s "a deliberate declaration,
    not a substring" convention. See `parse_marker` for why first-line-only is a security decision
    and not a style one. A first line that mentions the marker but is not exactly it is DENIED.
  * PER GOAL. It is read from THIS goal's body; no config key, label or other issue's marker is
    consulted.
  * SINGLE USE per goal+label. Granting posts an audit comment carrying
    `sigma:spend-approval-used=<label>`; any later call for the same label is DENIED. The human
    re-authorises by writing a NEW label. A comment can only ever make this check stricter (a
    forged used-marker denies), never looser.
  * AUDITED BEFORE GRANTED. The audit comment (marker line, issue author, the action, a body hash,
    the issue's `updated_at`, UTC time) must post successfully BEFORE `APPROVED` is returned; a post
    that fails is DENIED, so there is never an unaudited grant. The same entry is also written to
    the ledger, best effort.
  * RACE. After posting, the comments are read again; more than one used-marker for the label means
    two callers raced, and this one DENIES.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO -- stated plainly, because a half-guarantee described as a whole one is the
failure AGENTS.md's SAFETY property exists to prevent:

  (a) It cannot stop an agent that ignores the verb. Sigma has no code gate over an agent's own
      tool calls, so a paid step run without asking is not something this file can prevent; the
      SKILL prose is the accelerator and this verb is the authority it consults.
  (b) The author check is on who OPENED the issue, not on who last edited the body. ANY repo
      writer can add the marker to an issue an approver opened (in Sigma every collaborator is
      already in the trust set, so `approvers` only NARROWS who may open one; an editor check via
      userContentEdits is an optional follow-up, not built: it costs a GraphQL read); the audit comment's body hash and `updated_at` make
      that detectable afterwards, not impossible beforehand.
  (b2) Single-use state lives in issue comments only: whoever can delete the audit comment can
      re-arm a label, and any commenter can burn a label by posting its used-marker (deny-only). The ledger entry is written best-effort and never consulted. A transient
      retry inside `source.note` that double-posts burns the label (two used-markers) -- safe
      direction; the human writes a new one.
  (b3) The post-write re-read is eventually consistent: a re-read that does not yet show our own
      comment is DENIED although the audit comment stands (the label is burned; write a new one).
      A grant that LOSES the post-write race (or whose `note` retry double-posted) leaves its
      "honoured" audit comment on the issue even though the answer was DENIED; the comment's
      used-marker is what burns the label. The trail over-reports rather than under-reports.
  (c) Same-identity forgery. On a host where the loop runs under the operator's own GitHub login,
      the loop itself could append the marker to its own goal's body and then pass the author
      check. This verb authenticates "an approver wrote this issue", not "a human typed this
      line". The audit trail is what makes that visible. Closing it needs a human-only signal
      (a second identity, or a signed approval) and is NOT built here.
  (d) PART 2 IS OUT OF SCOPE. This is a boolean, per-use go-ahead. There is no dollar cap and no
      metering of external spend (a GPU host, a video-generation API, ...): Sigma has no hook into
      that billing, and `budget.max_tokens` meters only the loop's own token counter. A marker
      PARSING a cap would be one line; ENFORCING it needs spend reported back into a ledger or a
      provider balance check, a separate follow-up.

GITHUB QUOTA. The issue (body, author, `updated_at`) and the comments are read over REST
(`GitHubSource.fetch_issue_for_approval` / `fetch_comment_bodies`), never `gh issue view --json`,
for the reason `fetch_title_body` documents (#1808): GraphQL shares a far more easily exhausted
hourly budget. The one write is `source.note`, which already falls back to REST itself (#1657).

    FIRST BODY LINE ONLY, exactly like `design_goal.DESIGN_OF_MARKER` / `goal_size`'s markers (a
    deliberate declaration, not a substring found somewhere). This is a security decision, not a
    style one: an earlier version honoured a marker on any line outside code fences, and five
    adversarial review rounds each found another way GitHub's markdown renders such a line as code,
    a quote, a comment or a table cell while the parser saw prose (a fence in a list item, a fence
    opened inside an HTML comment, a multi-line code span, a comment re-opened on its own closing
    line, ...). Emulating CommonMark is an unbounded game; the first line of a body has NO preceding
    context that can change how it renders, so there is nothing to emulate.

    The first line, after normalising CRLF/CR, must be EXACTLY `sigma:spend-approved=<label>`,
    optionally wrapped in a complete `<!-- ... -->` (accepted, and note that wrapped form renders as an
    invisible comment); 0-3 leading spaces and any trailing space/tab are tolerated, nothing else (not NBSP, not a list/quote prefix, not a leading blank line or BOM, no trailing text).
    A first line that mentions the marker string but is not exactly that is MALFORMED (a typo must
