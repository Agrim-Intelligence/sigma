"""Secret-shaped redaction shared by the scripts/ backlog collectors (mirror + cross-check).

Location-only capture rule: never emit a matched secret VALUE — each match becomes a typed
placeholder, not the value. THIS file is the one pattern set: `hooks/research_capture.py` loads it by
path for web-research excerpts (the same way `hooks/time_track.py` loads its sibling scripts), and
the publish leak gate `tools/leak_scan.py` imports `SHAPE_RULES` below as its own secret rules — so
there is no second copy to keep in sync. Best-effort (pattern-based, not a guarantee) — which is why
anything this feeds (the board mirror, `.sdlc/knowledge/`) is ALSO gitignored (defense in depth)."""

#: `SHAPE_RULES` — every single-regex secret shape the publish leak gate detects, `(name, rx)`, with
#: the gate's contract: the secret VALUE is group 1 when the rx has a group, else the whole match.
#: `tools/leak_scan.py::_scrub_rules` IMPORTS this tuple (and Refuses when it is absent); it is never
#: copied there, and `scrub()` applies it via `_SECRET_PATTERNS` below. The gate keeps its own
#: post-filters (`_is_real_value`: a digit and a letter, not an identifier, not a placeholder) — a
#: gate's false-positive budget differs from a redactor's.
#:
#: Two edits vs. the gate's original text (#2718 D2): `url-password`'s scheme is bounded
#: `[a-z][a-z0-9+.-]{0,31}://` — unbounded it rescanned the hyphen run from every word boundary
#: (measured: 6,802 ms on a 100 KB `the-quick-brown-fox-` slug, 17,306 ms on `a-` x 50,000; bounded,
#: the whole scrub() on the same inputs ~36-45 ms) and the research hook scrubs WHOLE web bodies; and
#: `gitlab-token` is `{20,}` not `{20}`, so a longer token's tail no longer survives a redaction.
#: Exact-length rules (`npm-token` `{36}`, `google-key` `{35}`) redact only the first n characters
#: of a longer run and leave its tail — the same behaviour as the gate, which matches this regex.
#: Order: the specific `sk-` prefixes (anthropic, openai) before the generic `sk-key` so the label
#: names the provider (they cannot overlap: `sk-[A-Za-z0-9]{20,}` stops at the hyphen).
#:
#: GATE-ONLY, deliberately not here -- each is a rule `tools/leak_scan.py` implements and tests:
#: `key-body` (a private key body missing its header or END: line counts, a PRIVATE-header anchor
#: or a DER first line; a redactor would eat legitimate base64 in transcripts); `secret-file`
#: (`_SECRET_FILE`, a path rule, meaningless on text); `opaque-binary` / `oversize` / `unreadable`
#: (a whole-file verdict: the gate names the file and fails); and
#: `config-credential` (`_CONFIG_CRED`, keyed on the file's suffix, which runtime text has no notion
#: of). Concatenated or split token spellings are covered by NEITHER file (out of scope, stated in
#: the gate's docstring).
#: DEFERRED (follow-up issue, filed at #2718's retro): SSH2 `---- BEGIN SSH2 ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY
#: ----` (its unterminated form needs its own body walk — SSH2 bodies carry `Comment:` headers the
#: closed header list halts on; half of it would be a silent half-guarantee), PuTTY
#: `PuTTY-User-Key-File-N:` (no END marker; a plain regex would eat prose up to a later
#: `Private-MAC:`), base64-wrapped PEM (`LS0tLS1CRUdJTi...` needs the gate's decode check to tell a
#: wrapped private key from a wrapped public certificate). #2722 residuals: URL passwords are IN
#: (`url-password`); re-encoded secrets and entropy detection are OUT — the gate has no rule for
#: them, so there is nothing to share.

    #: json.dumps()/str() turn the key's newlines into literal \n ESCAPES, and a real-whitespace pattern
    #: stops dead at the first one. Proc-Type:/DEK-Info: are the RFC1421 encrypted-PEM headers that sit
    #: between header and body; that list is closed and colon-anchored (Subject:/Version:/Comment: are
    #: deliberately absent — they open ordinary prose). The body is a run of long base64 lines, so
    #: `{16,}` stops at short prose and a document merely DISCUSSING the marker keeps its text; the

    #:
    #: WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT COVER — the residual is NOT bounded to a fixed number of characters:
    #: consumption walks recognized headers and long base64 runs and STOPS at the first sub-16-char run
    #: or any non-base64 byte inside the body. Everything from that gap onward SURVIVES, however much
    #: of it there is. So a CANONICAL unterminated key — a clean body cut short at the source, which is
    #: the case this fallback exists for — is consumed in full; a MANGLED body (a foreign byte or a
    #: short run partway down) is redacted only as far as the gap, and complete key lines after it are
    #: published. Terminated keys never reach here at all: the DOTALL BEGIN..END pattern above owns
    #: them outright. The same stop rule is why an UNRECOGNIZED header line (e.g. `Comment:`) between
    #: BEGIN and the body halts consumption immediately and leaves the whole body — accepted on
    #: purpose, because the alternative is open-ended header matching that would eat ordinary prose.
    #: `(?: BLOCK)?` admits the PGP armor header (`-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----`); its
    #: UNTERMINATED form stops here too, at its `Version:`/`Comment:` armor lines (same accepted
    #: cost, pinned by test) — the terminated form is owned outright by the DOTALL pattern above.
    #: Both costs are pinned by test so the next reader meets the real behavior, not a comforting
    #: bound. Widening the run rule, or opening the header list, is a deliberate decision with its own
    #: false-positive price — not a typo to fix in passing.
