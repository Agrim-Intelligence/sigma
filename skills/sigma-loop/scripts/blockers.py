"""blockers.py (#1393) -- a blocked goal must be RESOLVED, routed, or parked for a named reason.
Never silently skipped.

THE DEADLOCK THIS EXISTS TO CLOSE. When a goal hits a dependency, Sigma records the block and
moves on. That is correct only if something will eventually work the blocker. Three of the four
paths satisfy that; one does not, and it is the one Sigma walks down itself:

    goal #42 hits a dependency
      |
      +-- cross-area hand-off (same_area=False, blocks_goal=True)
      |     issue opened WITH goal_label, ASSIGNED, ledger kind="handoff" to=owner.
      |     autowatch surfaces it. This path is fine.
      |
      +-- same-area, immediately_actionable=False
      |     issue opened with proposed_label and NO goal_label; ledger entry is only kind="note",
      |     which autowatch does not watch; goal #42 -> sdlc:blocked.
      |     Nothing can pick the blocker. `auto_unpark` will not resume #42 until the blocker
      |     CLOSES. Neither side can move. Sigma built this, and told nobody.
      |
      +-- a human writes "Blocked by #N" against a plain repo issue
            precheck parks #42; no ledger entry at all. Same deadlock, different origin.

`sdlc:blocking` does not rescue any of it: it RE-RANKS issues that are already eligible.
`_blocking_priority_pending` reuses `_fetch_pending`, whose base query always carries
`--label goal_label`, and `gh issue list --label` ANDs repeated flags -- so a blocker without
`goal_label` is reachable by no queue at all.

THE RULE, and it is the whole module: a block is resolved, routed to whoever owns it, or parked
with a reason from a closed set. There is no fourth option and no silent one.

WHY PROMOTION IS NOT "DEFEATING THE APPROVAL GATE". The gate (#233) exists to stop SPECULATIVE
AI-filed work from consuming the backlog. An issue that real, already-approved work is now stalled
behind is by definition not speculative. And the label pair is decisive: `sdlc:followup` means
Sigma filed it, `proposed_label` means NO HUMAN HAS EVER RULED ON IT -- so there is no human
decision to override. When a human filed the proposal themselves, `sdlc:followup` is absent and the
verdict is `needs_human` instead. This is the provenance label earning its keep.

WHAT THIS MODULE WILL NOT DO:
  - promote a proposal a HUMAN filed (`needs_human`) -- that is a real decision, already made;
  - un-park anything (`chained`) -- a park is human-owned, and `auto_unpark` is the only sweep
    allowed to reverse one, on evidence this module does not have;
  - adopt an unlabelled third-party issue into `goal_label` (`unmanaged`) -- it was never ours, so
    it cannot be "lost as an orphan", and adopting it would put Sigma to work on somebody
    else's backlog.

#: self-reinforcing bug found by an adversarial audit:
#:
#:   `auto_unpark.compute_blocking_actions` writes `sdlc:blocking` to a third-party blocker while
#:   DELIBERATELY withholding membership (verdict `unmanaged` -- it was never Sigma's to adopt).
#:   One pass later that same issue carries `sdlc:blocking`, "any sdlc:* label" reads it as proof of
#:   ownership, the verdict flips to `routed`, and membership is granted after all. Sigma's own
#:   annotation became its own evidence, and the withheld decision silently reversed itself -- with
#:   `blocking_priority_override` on, the adopted third-party issue then sorts ahead of every real
#:   goal.
#:
#: Provenance is the only honest evidence here: `sdlc:followup` is stamped on every issue
#: `handoff.create_tracked_issue` files, and `sdlc:dependency` on every cross-area hand-off. Both
#: are written ONLY at filing time, by Sigma, about an issue Sigma created. A derived
#: annotation can never say who owns something.
_PROVENANCE = (handoff.FOLLOWUP_LABEL, handoff.DEPENDENCY_LABEL)

#: The ONLY reasons a block may end in a park. Anything else is an escalation, not a park -- the
#: user's rule, made checkable: "never skip it knowingly until it is sure that this is going to be
#: parked due to insufficient permissions, knowledge, or a known blocker."
