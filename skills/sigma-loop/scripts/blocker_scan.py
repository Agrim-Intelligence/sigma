"""Dependency-marker vocabulary — the ONE definition of what "this issue is blocked by #N"
looks like in text, plus the fixed spans that must never be scanned for it (#1487).

Extracted from `backlog_check.py` so that BOTH ends of the pipeline can apply the identical scan:

  - `backlog_check._explicit_blockers` / `_referenced_blocker_refs` scan a goal's corpus text at
    CHECK time (plus its comment text, which never rides the mirror at all);
  - `mirror.normalize_issue` scans an issue's FULL body once at FETCH time and stores the refs it
    finds on the record, because the mirror keeps only a 500-character body EXCERPT and
    `compile_plan` writes its `**Blocked by:** #N` marker at the END of a body — so any issue
    longer than the cap had its dependency silently truncated away and unenforced.

The two scans share the character class, the proximity window and the capture groups, but NOT the
trigger set: the fetch-time one is restricted to `EXPLICIT_TRIGGERS` because it reads ~10x the text.
See `TRIGGERS` below — that asymmetry is the point of this module, not an accident in it.

`mirror.py` is the LOWER module (`backlog_check` imports it, never the reverse), so the vocabulary
could not live in either of them without inverting that edge or duplicating the regex. It lives
here, and both import it. `backlog_check` re-exports `_BLOCK_RE`, `UNPARK_QA_START`,
`UNPARK_QA_END` and `_strip_unpark_qa` as its own module attributes, so every existing reader —
`doctor.py` (`_load_loop_script("backlog_check")._BLOCK_RE`), `triage.py` and `sources.py` (which
both read it LIVE off the module attribute by contract), `unpark.py` (`backlog_check.
UNPARK_QA_START`) — keeps working verbatim against an equivalent pattern. (Usually the IDENTICAL
object, but only because `re.compile` caches: `_load()` never registers in `sys.modules`, so each
call re-executes this file, and `re.purge()` between two loads yields two distinct compiled objects
with equal patterns. Nothing asserts identity, and nothing should.)

ONE consequence of that, worth knowing before writing a test: monkeypatching
`backlog_check._BLOCK_RE` does NOT reach `extract_refs`, which resolves the pattern through this
module's own globals. `sources.py` and `triage.py` document "read it live so a patch propagates" as
a contract; after #1487 that holds for the check-time scanners only. The source-level pin
(`test_the_block_vocabulary_is_declared_only_in_blocker_scan`) is what guards the fetch-time side.

Pure, with ONE sibling dependency: `legacy.py` (#239), loaded once at import so an unpark block
written under the plugin's previous name strips too. `legacy.py` is itself stdlib-only and does no
I/O at import, so nothing here does I/O either. It sits under `mirror.normalize_issue`, which runs
once per issue on a board-sized fetch; the per-call cost is still a bounded number of `find`s.

#: #1393: the character class excludes CLAUSE PUNCTUATION (`, ; . ! ?`), not just newlines and `#`.
#:
#: A trigger phrase and a `#N` on opposite sides of a clause boundary are almost never a dependency:
#: the ref is not the trigger's object, it is a separate remark. Measured against the marker and
#: prose forms this repo actually writes -- every real one survives, two whole classes of false
#: positive stop matching:
#:
#:     **Blocked by:** #123          match -> match     (the canonical marker every writer emits)
#:     Blocked by #99                match -> match
#:     this depends on #7            match -> match
#:     requires the new parser in #7 match -> match
#:     waiting on the sign-off, see #1234    match -> NO MATCH
#:     we need this after the release. see #77   match -> NO MATCH
#:
#: This REDUCES the false-positive rate; it does not eliminate it, and that is not a solvable
#: problem with a regex over prose. `after #40 lands` and `...this actually needs #9 to land first`
#: still match, because nothing about their SHAPE distinguishes them from a real dependency -- only
#: their meaning does. Two deliberate escapes exist for the residue and are documented for adopters:
#: a dismissal comment (`backlog_check.py dismiss-text`) retires one specific (kind, ref) match, and
#: `auto_unpark.KEEP_PARKED_MARKER` opts a goal out of the sweep entirely. See
#: `test_block_re_boundary_table` for the pinned behaviour of every case above.
#:
#: The cost is a real false NEGATIVE: `blocked by the parser, see #7` no longer registers. That is
#: the right trade -- a missed edge costs one out-of-order pick, while a phantom edge parks a goal
#: that nothing will unpark, and the reliable form (`Blocked by: #N`, nothing between) is what every
#: Sigma writer already emits.
#:
#: THE TWO SCANS ARE NOT THE SAME WIDTH, and that is deliberate (#1487 review). Everything above
#: describes a vocabulary CALIBRATED AGAINST A 500-CHARACTER EXCERPT -- that is the only text the
#: check-time scanners in `backlog_check.py` were ever pointed at, and the documented residue was
#: tolerable at that size. `mirror.normalize_issue` now scans a WHOLE BODY, and on the repo this was
#: measured against 395 of 400 issues are longer than the cap, so the same vocabulary over the same
#: board covers roughly ten times the text. Measured at that width the residue stops being
#: theoretical: 22 new confident edges, 21 genuine `blocked by` markers and one phantom off `after`
#: --
#:
#:     "...until a real user hit it after Phase 2 (#1396) went live."   -> blocked-by #1396, score 1.0
#:
#: -- narrative prose about a past event, emitted `confident`. A confident `blocked-by` finding is
#: not advisory: `loop.py`'s `_resolve_blockers_for_park` hands it to `blockers.resolve`, which
#: WRITES TO THE REFERENCED ISSUE (a `sdlc:proposed` -> `sdlc:goal` label swap, a board move and a
#: comment), and `auto_unpark.compute_blocking_actions` then stamps `sdlc:blocking` on it. One
#: sentence of English past character 500 would stall a real goal AND mutate a third, unrelated
#: issue, unattended.
#:
#: So the FETCH-TIME scan uses `EXPLICIT_TRIGGERS` -- the three phrases whose shape carries the
#: dependency and not just the vocabulary. On that same corpus the narrowing keeps 21 of 21 genuine
#: edges and drops the phantom, and it costs nothing this repo generates: `compile_plan`,
#: `handoff` and `triage` all write the same `**Blocked by:** #N` marker. The CHECK-TIME scan keeps
#: the full `TRIGGERS` set exactly as #1393 left it -- MATCHING moves for nobody, a weak trigger
#: inside the excerpt is found today and is still found -- but #1497 found the identical live-write
#: exposure one level up: `backlog_check._explicit_blockers` scans the excerpt with this same full
#: vocabulary and, before #1497, marked EVERY match `confident` regardless of phrase, so the same
#: `sdlc:needs-confirmation` label text or a quoted "needs human review" park comment reaching
#: `_resolve_blockers_for_park` could mutate a third issue from inside the 500-character excerpt,
#: no truncation required. `_explicit_blockers` now sets `confident` only for an `EXPLICIT_TRIGGERS`
#: phrase, so presence is unchanged (this docstring's claim still holds) but a weak-trigger match is
#: advisory, never acted on.

#: unblocked, and `precheck` would re-park it on the very next pick: the goal gets unparked, a human
#: spends real effort answering, work starts, and the recorded answers park it again.
