"""The canonical Sigma board (#234): its fields and its six views, as DATA, built at call time from
the kit's own vocabulary. This is the one source of truth `board_layout.py` applies and verifies,
and the one `docs/board.md` describes. Nothing here talks to GitHub.

Nothing is copied from elsewhere. The Status options are the configured columns
(`sources.GitHubSource.col`), Priority's are `discovery.PRIORITIES` (`P0`..`P4`), Phase's are
`phase_report.PHASE_TOKENS` with `PHASE_BOARD_COLORS`, and the "Needs a human" labels are the
source's own `parked_label` / `goal_blocked_label` / `proposed_label`. Change one of those and the
spec follows.

WHAT THE API CAN SET (read-only schema introspection, 2026-09-29, the evidence recorded on #234): a view's
name, layout and visible fields (`createProjectV2View`), and its filter (`updateProjectV2View`
only). Group-by, sort, the board's column field, roadmap date fields and markers, and the view
order have NO input anywhere; they are in each view as `manual` properties, which `board_layout.py`
prints as exact UI steps and `verify` reads back.
