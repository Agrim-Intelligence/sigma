"""compile_plan.py (#918) -- the "given a DECIDED plan, create it for real" layer of the
agrim-scope skill (epic #902, wave 1). Takes a structured plan a reasoning layer has already
decided on (titles, bodies, priorities, and dependency edges between SIBLING issues in the same
plan, plus an optional epic wrapper) and turns it into real GitHub (or local-goals) issues: real
`priority:P<n>` label AND board field (both sides), a real `epic`-labelled tracking issue when the
plan warrants one, and real "Blocked by #N" body markers wiring the genuine dependency edges.

This module does NOT decide what a plan should contain, whether two issues are duplicates, who gets
assigned, or whether work starts now -- that reasoning belongs to sibling sub-issues of the same
epic (#916 target resolution, #917 dedup, #919 assignment + execution paths, #920 orchestration).
This is purely the mechanical compiler: structure in, real tracked issues out.

REUSE DECISION (the issue's own first design question), read `handoff.py` and `sources.py` FIRST
before assuming either fits:

  `GitHubSource.create_dependency` / `LocalSource.create_dependency` -- YES, reused directly, for
  every actual issue-creation call in this module. They already handle the per-label `gh label
  create` (idempotent, and since #1917 non-destructive: it creates a label that is missing and
  leaves one that exists alone), the create-then-assign split (never combined -- an assignee `gh` rejects must not orphan
  the issue), and -- via `create_dependency`'s own trailing `_apply_custom_fields`/`_mirror_priority`
  call -- the priority label+field DUAL WRITE the acceptance criteria asks for. Nothing about that
  machinery needs reimplementing; this module only ever has to hand it the right `labels=[...]`.

  `handoff.create_tracked_issue` -- NOT reused, deliberately, after reading it closely (not assumed).
  Its `blocks_goal=True` marker channel writes "**Blocked by:** #<new issue>" onto the CALLING
  goal's OWN body (`source.append_to_body(str(goal), ...)`) -- i.e. "the goal I'm filing FROM is
  blocked by the issue I just made". That is exactly backwards for what #918 needs: issue B (a new
  plan issue) blocked by sibling issue A (ALSO a new plan issue), with no "calling goal" involved at
  all -- there is no `goal` for create_tracked_issue's marker to land on that would mean the right
  thing. Its `same_area`/`immediately_actionable`/`owners.owner_of` axes are also aimed at "who does
  this park on", a question #919 owns, not #918. Reusing it here would have silently mis-wired every
  sibling dependency edge (or required contorting its API into a shape it wasn't built for) -- so
  this module goes one layer down instead and reuses `create_dependency` directly, the same primitive
  `create_tracked_issue` itself is a thin wrapper over. `PROPOSED_LABEL`/`proposed_label()` (the
  #233 "queued but queryable" convention) is the one piece of `handoff.py` still reused as-is, live
  (see `goal_label` below) -- that mapping (not-yet-actionable -> a DISTINCT label, not just a
  missing one) is a real, already-solved problem this module would otherwise silently reintroduce.

CREATION-ORDER DECISION (the issue's second design question): issues are created in DEPENDENCY
(topological) order, blocker before dependant, and a dependant's "Blocked by #N" marker(s) are
embedded directly in its INITIAL body at creation time -- never patched in as a second pass. This
was chosen over "create all issues first, then patch markers in" because it is strictly safer:
embedding at creation is atomic with the issue existing at all, so there is no window where a
dependant issue is live on the board without the blocker marker that is supposed to gate it (a
two-phase patch has exactly that window if the patch step itself fails, or the run is interrupted
between phases). It also costs fewer `gh` calls (no `append_to_body` read-modify-write per edge).
The ONE deliberate exception is the epic's own back-reference to its subs (`_patch_epic_with_subs`
below): the epic is created FIRST, before any sub-issue has a real number, so there is no way to
embed that reference at creation time -- it is patched in afterward, once, via `append_to_body`,
exactly the shape `triage.py`'s own `enact()` already uses for the identical primitive. That does
not weaken the "always atomic" property for genuine dependency (`blocked_by`) edges, which is the
part `backlog_check._explicit_blockers()` actually gates auto-skip on -- the epic's tracking text is
informational only (an epic is never blocked; see `_EPIC_TRACK_TMPL` below for why it is worded to
never match `_BLOCK_RE` at all).

EPIC-OR-NOT DECISION (the issue's third design question): the epic wrapper is created iff the plan
supplies one AND the plan has MORE THAN ONE issue. A single-issue plan needs no wrapper regardless
of what the caller happened to hand in -- issue count is the objective, structural signal, so this
function stays correct even if the layer deciding what belongs in a plan (#920, not built yet)
doesn't itself special-case the single-issue case.

MULTI-BLOCKER MARKER SAFETY (the regex trap named in the issue and in
the #902 plan): `backlog_check._BLOCK_RE` captures exactly ONE `#N` per
trigger-phrase occurrence -- a comma-joined "Blocked by #12, #13" silently registers only #12.
`_blocker_marker_lines()` below NEVER joins numbers with a comma or any other separator on one
phrase occurrence -- it repeats the literal `"**Blocked by:** #{n}"` template (byte-identical to
the ONE other place in this codebase that writes this marker, `handoff.py`'s own literal string,
and to `triage.py`'s `_MARKER_TMPL`) once per blocker, one per line. Every test in
`tests/test_compile_plan.py` that exercises a multi-blocker issue asserts this against the LIVE
`backlog_check._BLOCK_RE` (not a hand-copied duplicate that could quietly drift from the real one).

FAILURE-MIDWAY DECISION: nothing is rolled back on a failure (there is no `gh` bulk-delete of
issues, and closing a just-created issue would just be a second, differently-shaped failure mode to
handle) -- this module instead guarantees the report is always an honest, complete account of what
did and didn't land. A failed issue is recorded in `report["failed"]`; anything (transitively)
`blocked_by` a failed OR skipped issue is never attempted at all -- created "half-blocked" (a
dependant whose marker would have to reference an issue that doesn't exist) is a strictly worse
failure mode than not creating it, so it is skipped and recorded in `report["skipped"]` instead. A
genuinely independent issue elsewhere in the same plan is unaffected.

    `forbid_priority` (default False, #2027): whether a `priority` key anywhere in the plan (on the
    epic or on any child) is a REFUSAL rather than an input. OPT-IN deliberately, and the default
    is what keeps it that way: this same function is the agrim-scope path's compiler, and
    `skills/agrim-scope/SKILL.md` mandates "a real `P0`-`P4` priority" per issue there, so a blanket
    guard would break the caller it was never aimed at. The Dossier pipeline is the one that opts
    in, because `docs/dossier-pipeline.md` §7f forbids the key on that path -- and until this flag
    existed that rule was honour-system prose, which the 2026-09-01 validation run (story #2017)
    walked straight past on all six children with nothing to detect it. Checked as the FIRST
    statement of this function: before the empty-`issues[]` early return (an epic-only plan is
    still a plan), before `_validate_and_order`, and before the source is resolved -- so a raise
    still means nothing whatsoever happened.

    `source`: an object with `create_dependency`/`append_to_body` (the `GitHubSource`/`LocalSource`
    duck-typed contract `handoff.create_tracked_issue` already establishes). Resolved via

def main(argv):
    """Thin CLI: `compile_plan.py <sdlc_dir> --plan <path.json> [--actionable] [--json]
    [--forbid-priority]`. Reads a plan as a JSON file, compiles it against the configured backlog
    source, and prints a short summary. Exit codes: 0 (every plan issue landed), 1 (at least one
    failed or was skipped), 2 (usage error, a structurally invalid plan, or a plan that carries a
    priority it may not -- nothing was created in any of those cases).

    `--forbid-priority` (#2027) turns on `compile_plan`'s own opt-in refusal of a `priority` key
    (see that function's docstring for why it is opt-in rather than blanket). It is ALSO turned on,
    without the flag, for any plan file living in `_DOSSIER_PLAN_DIR` -- and that backstop is the
    point of the change rather than a nicety. The rule it enforces was already written in
    `docs/dossier-pipeline.md` §7f and in `skills/agrim-goal-review/SKILL.md`, and a real run walked
    past both; a caller that can skip a paragraph of prose can skip a flag in the same paragraph, so
    a flag alone would have been the same honour system with an extra step. The plan's own PATH is
    contractual (both documents mandate it, `mkdir -p` included), so it is evidence about which
    pipeline produced the plan that does not depend on the producer remembering anything.

    `--json` (#1919) is the MACHINE channel, added because `skills/agrim-goal-review/SKILL.md` steps
    4b/4e are written against `report["epic"]` and `report["issues"]` while mandating this CLI,
    which had no way to emit either: stdout carried prose, in DEPENDENCY (topological) rather than
    plan order, and the warnings went to a different stream entirely. With the flag, stdout is
    EXACTLY one JSON object -- the whole report, `_json_report`'s shape -- and nothing else, so
    `json.loads` on the captured stdout is the entire parse. Ordering stops mattering because the
    consumer reads by KEY.

    Deliberately NOT changed by the flag: the stderr diagnostics (warnings, FAILED, SKIPPED) still
    print exactly where they always did, so a human running it by hand still sees why something did
    not land -- the JSON carries the same facts, it does not relocate them. Nor the exit codes. On a
    usage or unreadable-plan failure there is no report at all, so stdout stays EMPTY rather than
    emitting an empty object: "nothing was created" and "created nothing" have to stay
    distinguishable."""
