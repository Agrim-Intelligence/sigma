"""Model auto-selection — predict the portable tier a goal deserves, so the loop runs its phases at
a capability matched to the work instead of one-size-fits-all. Deterministic regex over the goal
text (like the intent hook), so it's zero-dep, hermetically testable, and never drifts. Returns one
of the shared tier labels: haiku | sonnet | opus | fable; ``host-model`` resolves a Codex tier to a
real model ID and reasoning effort before dispatch.

Predict ONCE from the goal; the loop then runs that goal's phases at the returned tier (the design:
"the rest of the steps will be executed with that model"). Conflicts resolve UPWARD to the more
capable tier — over-powering a mislabelled goal is cheaper than under-powering a hard one.

THAT PREMISE IS FALSE AT EXACTLY ONE TIER, and #2564 is the bill for it: `fable` is priced ABOVE
opus ($10/$50 per 1M vs $5/$25), so promoting a goal to it is not cheap over-powering, it is the
most expensive answer available. One creative stem anywhere in title+body was enough, and an
unattended overnight run exhausted an account's credits. A PRICE CEILING therefore sits over the
whole router (`model_selection_max_tier`, default `opus`, so fable is unreachable unless a repo
opts in) — see `_TIER_PRICE_ORDER` and `predict_with_reason`'s own `max_tier`. Upward resolution is
unchanged BELOW the ceiling; the ceiling is what makes it safe to keep. This can
escalate a mundane phrasing hard: "fix the 401 unauthorized response formatting" reaches opus/high
on the `authoriz` signal alone, well past what "response formatting" alone would suggest — accepted,
not a bug (#595): a goal mentioning authorization for ANY reason is treated as authorization-
adjacent, never assumed benign, and `_PATTERNS`' high-to-low ordering means that signal always wins
ties within one string.

Two axes, one gate (`model_selection: "auto"`): the MODEL tier (which brain) and the reasoning
EFFORT (how hard it thinks: low|medium|high). Resolution is available at two granularities —
per GOAL (`resolve`, the ceiling for the goal's phases) and per STEP (`resolve-step`, so a
mechanical step inside a hard goal — run the tests, watch a job, lint — can run on a cheaper
tier/effort than the goal's ceiling). Step conflicts resolve upward within the step text.

RECORDING THE CHOICE (issue #1030). `resolve`/`resolve_step` don't only predict — given a `goal`
identifier, each also shells out to `loop.py emit ... model_choice --model <tier> --signal
<signal>` before returning, so the tier reaches the team ledger unconditionally rather than
depending on a calling skill's SKILL.md remembering a second instruction (see `_emit_model_choice`
for the full reasoning, and why this is the one place in this module that is NOT zero-dep/pure —
`predict`/`predict_with_reason`/`predict_effort` remain exactly that). `why` (below) is the
deliberate exception: still pure, still writes nothing, on purpose.

A HAIKU SIGNAL COUNTS ONLY IN THE TITLE (#2827). The upward-resolution premise has a mirror image
one tier down: a real issue body almost always quotes a code comment, names a docstring or cites a
lint, so scanning the body for haiku stems routed non-trivial goals DOWN to the cheapest tier on one
body word (a P1 multi-module fix ran at haiku on `comment` alone; the predecessor's census of its own
two boards found 24 open goals routed that way -- not measured on Sigma's). Under-powering is the
costly error, so haiku is the one tier read from the TITLE only; opus/fable stems keep scanning
title+body. The title is the text's FIRST LINE -- the shape `loop.py` builds at pick time
(`"<title>\n\n<body>"`) and the one fallback gesture the skills document prints -- so a single-line
string is all title and routes exactly as before. A goal FILE path is read by `_read_goal`, which
puts the file's own title on that first line. `resolve_step` keeps whole-text haiku scanning: a
mechanical step's downgrade is what that verb is for.

PER-REPO SIGNAL EXCLUDES (issue #1601). A signal can be a creative term on most repos and an
ordinary DOMAIN NOUN on a few: a storytelling pipeline has a "narrative stage" and a "prose
renderer", and `vision` collides with Sigma's OWN vision-first vocabulary (`/sigma-vision`, the
north-star doc), so "align the retry logic with the north-star vision doc" reached `fable`. #350
fixed the same class by NARROWING the global pattern (bare `story` dropped, `storytell` kept); that
remedy does not generalize, because those terms are genuinely creative elsewhere -- no one global
pattern can be right for every repo, which leaves the PER-REPO axis as the only correct one.
`model_selection_signal_excludes` in `.sdlc/config.json` therefore lets a repo neutralize named
signals locally; see `_is_excluded` for what an entry keys on and `predict_with_reason` for the
fall-through. Ships empty, so a repo that configures nothing is byte-identical (pinned by
test_no_config_is_byte_identical_to_the_pre_1601_router, over the whole signal vocabulary).

Worth fixing but NOT worth redesigning, because the harm is asymmetric. In interactive `/sigma-goal`
the prediction is ADVISORY -- the phases run inline on the session model and the tier is only
surfaced, so a wrong answer costs a misleading line. In `/sigma-loop` under `model_selection: "auto"`
it is REAL: the resolved tier is the goal's ceiling and each phase is dispatched as a subagent AT
that tier, so a false `fable` genuinely runs implementation and review on the creative tier. A
bounded per-repo opt-out buys back the real half; the LLM classifier named below stays the answer to
the general problem, and is deliberately NOT what this is.

ponytail: heuristic with a known ceiling. Upgrade path = swap `predict` for an LLM classifier behind
the same signature if the keyword rubric ever proves too coarse; the config flag + tests stay put."""

    # in "rearchitect". Naming the DEFECT rather than the property is how these goals are usually
    # filed, so the blind spot hit the common case — and hyphenating restored the boundary, making
    # "Re-architect" and "Rearchitect" route differently for no reason a reader could predict.
    # #543 fixed `secur`; #575 finished the sweep.

    # The prefix is admitted PER TERM, never globally, because `un-` does not mean one thing:

    #     so opus is right;
    #   * on a capability term it can name the mere ABSENCE of the property — "uncomplex" is not a
    #     complexity goal at all, so `complex` deliberately keeps its bare boundary.
    # ("unscalable" reads the first way, not the second: it means the system does not scale.)
    # Each widening was dictionary-swept (/usr/share/dict/words) for what it newly admits; every hit
    # was a negation or repetition of the intended term, no unrelated word. Kept in lockstep with the

    #
    # #595 added two more, same method: `authoriz` -> `authori[sz]` for the British -ise spelling
    # (authorised/authorisation) — the dictionary has no -ise form of this word at all, so the sweep
    # instead confirms no UNRELATED word is newly admitted (swept both bare and `un`-prefixed, since
    # the live pattern is `(?:un)?authori[sz]`: three obscure hits, "authorish"/"authorism"/
    # "unauthorish", all plainly on-topic, none a real risk of a false trigger). `migrat` ->
    # `(?:re|un)?migrat` to also admit `un-` ("unmigrated" — not yet migrated, work still needed —
    # the same defect-to-fix shape the security cluster's `un-` has, not the absence-of-property
    # shape `complex` deliberately keeps bare): swept, the only newly-admitted form is
    # "unmigrating"; every other `[prefix]migrat` dictionary word (emigrate/immigrate/transmigrate/
    # nonemigration/...) uses a DIFFERENT prefix and stays correctly excluded.
    #
    # #1627 added a THIRD, differently-shaped widening: `auth[nz]?\b` admits the bare abbreviation
    # itself (auth/authn/authz) rather than a prefix of an existing full word — `authenticat`/
    # `authori[sz]` above never fire on "the auth token refresh path" because neither "authenticat"
    # nor "authori" appears in it at all. This term is the ONLY one in either list carrying its own
    # TRAILING `\b`, scoped to just this one alternative (every sibling term keeps the existing
    # no-trailing-boundary shape) — without it, bare `auth` would match as a PREFIX inside

    gets wrong:
      * a PHRASE ("north-star vision") under-blocks: only that wording is suppressed, and the next
        goal that phrases it differently misroutes again;
      * a TIER (a "fable off" switch) over-blocks: a genuinely creative goal on a narrative-heavy
        repo could then never reach `fable` at all;
        (#2564 added a tier-granularity knob anyway — `model_selection_max_tier` — and this
        paragraph is NOT a ruling against it. The objection here is to using a tier switch to solve
        a DOMAIN VOCABULARY problem, where a signal is the right granularity. That other knob
        answers a different question, PRICE, and the over-block named here is precisely its intent:
        it is reversed by one config line on the repos that want fable. Both knobs are live, both
        are honoured, and they compose without interacting — the ceiling reads only the finished
        scan's result.)
      * a SIGNAL neutralizes one branch wherever it fires, leaving the tier's OTHER branches live --
        so that same repo still reaches `fable` via `storytell`/`blog`/`marketing copy`/`tagline`.
    That last one is the granularity the excluded repo actually wants, so it is what this keys on.

    Comparison is case-insensitive containment in BOTH directions, because the string a user can
    write and the literal the router matched are rarely the same one:
      * entry contained in signal -- one stem covers every prefixed form a pattern admits (`secur`
        covers the `insecur` that `(?:in|un)?secur` actually matches), instead of making the repo
        enumerate `authoriz`/`unauthoriz`/`authoris`/`unauthoris` by hand;
      * signal contained in entry -- a repo can write the natural word ("narrative") without having
        to know the router's internal stem ("narrativ", which is what `why` prints).
    The accepted cost is the same in every direction: an excluded signal is excluded for the whole
    repo, including on a goal where it WAS meant creatively. That is the deliberate trade -- it is
    opt-in, per repo, and declared by the person who knows their own vocabulary.

    Entries are stripped and lowercased HERE as well as in `signal_excludes`, which is not a
    duplicated guard but two different jobs at two different doors: `signal_excludes` parses the
    config SHAPE (list-vs-string, non-string junk) and can only protect the config path, while this
    normalizes the COMPARISON and so protects every caller, including a direct Python one that built
    the list itself. A blank entry is the reason the second door matters at all: `"" in anything` is
    True, so one empty string would exclude every signal on every goal and silently flatten the
    router to `_DEFAULT` -- the loudest possible failure, from the quietest possible typo.

    `signal` is always a real match literal and never empty (no `_PATTERNS` branch can match the
    empty string), so there is deliberately no guard for that case -- a guard the one call site
    cannot reach is dead code, and dead code that looks like a safety check is worse than none.
    A non-string ENTRY is likewise not defended here: the config path is already type-filtered by

# POLICY (#575) — this list is a deliberate SUBSET of the model list above, not a stale copy of it,

# domain demands (stakes, blast radius if it goes wrong), the EFFORT tier asks how much reasoning
# the work itself demands. They diverge in BOTH directions, on purpose:
#   * `debug` / `root cause` / `diagnos` are high effort but NOT opus — following a fault through a
#     system is deep reasoning, not specialist capability. (Proof this list was never just a copy.)
#   * `financial` / `payment` / `multi-service` / `complex` / `scalab` / `scaling` / `performance`
#     are opus but NOT automatically high effort — they raise the cost of being wrong without
#     making the individual change harder to reason about. A one-line price-rounding fix is still
#     one line; it just deserves the better model. `complex` names the SYSTEM's property, not the
#     change's own difficulty, which is why it belongs here rather than being self-contradictory:
#     when a complex-system change genuinely IS hard reasoning too, the effort axis catches that
#     independently (e.g. "debug the complex scheduling logic" reaches high effort via `debug`).
# This split is at its most visible on one pair (#595, decided, not changed): "diagnose the latency
# regression" is sonnet/high (`diagnos` names the deep-reasoning verb, no opus-list term appears);
# "fix the performance regression" is opus/medium (`performance` names the high-stakes domain, not
# an effort-list term) — the SAME underlying problem, phrased two ways, at opposite ends of BOTH
# axes. Not a bug: each phrasing correctly triggers a different word on a different axis. Moving the

    `predict()` used to run this loop and drop `re.search`'s match on the floor, so the tier was
    recorded everywhere and the reason nowhere. `signal` is `match.group(0)`: the actual substring
    that fired ("migrat", "secur"), never a paraphrase of the rule — a reader can check it against
    the goal text themselves, which a restated rule does not allow.

    `None` when no pattern matched and the FLOOR applies -- `_DEFAULT` only when `max_tier` is at
    or above `_DEFAULT`'s own price rank; a cap BELOW `_DEFAULT` binds the no-match case too (code
    review, #2564: the line used to name `_DEFAULT` unconditionally, which stopped being accurate
    the moment this function gained a cap that can sit under it -- `test_cap_also_binds_the_
    default_tier` pins the binding). "Nothing matched" is still the honest answer either way;
    manufacturing a reason for a defaulted or floored tier would be worse than recording none.

    `max_tier` (issue #2564): the PRICE ceiling, defaulting to `_MAX_TIER_DEFAULT` so the guard is
    on for every caller including a direct Python one. The scan is UNTOUCHED -- it runs exactly as
    it did, and the ceiling reads only its result, so this composes with `excludes` rather than
    interacting with it. When the winning tier is priced above the ceiling the TIER clamps to
    `min(_DEFAULT, cap)` and THE SIGNAL THAT FIRED IS KEPT -- returning `None` there would make
    `('sonnet', None)` mean two different things (see the paragraph above), blank out the literal
    `model_selection_signal_excludes`' own documented discovery gesture tells a repo to copy from
    `why`, and leave every capped goal's `model_choice` ledger event with no reason at all, since
    `loop.py` adds `signal` to that event only when it is truthy.

    Clamping to `_DEFAULT` rather than FALLING THROUGH to the next tier is the load-bearing choice,
    and it is the opposite of what `excludes` does one level down. Fall-through reproduces #2564's
    own expected table, and sends "rewrite the marketing copy for the pricing page and rename the
    CTA constant" to HAIKU -- a 10x capability drop, two tiers below `_DEFAULT`. The router cannot
    distinguish that from "fix the typo in the blog post title": both are one fable stem plus one
    haiku stem, and a haiku stem in the TITLE -- the only place one counts since #2827 -- is still
    common enough on a real goal that fall-through would misroute. Clamping keeps this module's
    own upward-resolution invariant true, erring at 2x on a
    trivial goal instead of at 0.5x on a hard one.

    `_PATTERNS` is ordered high-to-low, so on a mixed goal ("fix the typo in the security module"
    → opus) the signal returned is the one that WON. Reporting a losing signal beside the winning
    tier would be actively misleading, which is why a test pins exactly that case.

    `excludes` (issue #1601, optional): signals this repo has declared to be domain vocabulary --
    see `_is_excluded` for what an entry names. Still PURE: the list is passed in, never read from
    disk here, so this keeps the zero-dep/hermetic contract the module docstring states;
    `resolve`/`resolve_step`/`main` are the ones that read config and hand it down.

    An excluded signal FALLS THROUGH -- the scan resumes rather than stopping -- and it resumes
    INSIDE THE SAME TIER FIRST, which is why this is `finditer` and not `re.search`. `re.search`
    returns the leftmost match only, so "rewrite the narrative storytelling guide" with `narrativ`
    excluded would report the excluded signal and, skipping to the next tier on that basis, drop a
    genuinely creative goal to sonnet. Only when NO branch of a tier survives does the next tier get
    its turn, in the same high-to-low order -- so exclusion never reorders the tiers, it only
    removes a reason to stop. With no excludes, `finditer`'s first match IS `re.search`'s match and
    every call returns on it, which is what makes the unconfigured default byte-identical.
