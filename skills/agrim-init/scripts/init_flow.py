"""The ONE entry point a new user runs after installing Sigma (#236): `/agrim-init` (and its alias
`/agrim-setup`) run this, on every host.

WHY. Before #236 there were three doors: `sdlc_init.py` wrote files and asked nothing, `/agrim-setup`
adopted GitHub by model judgment around `setup.py` (and set github mode with no repository), and the
wizard was a Claude-Code-only session hook. `sdlc_init.py --github` created labels on GitHub but left
`discovery.source: local-goals`, so the loop never read the issues it had just made pickable -- and
the first thing it picked on every fresh repository was the scaffolded "Example goal".

WHAT. One flow, in this order, integrating the sibling goals rather than re-implementing them:
  1. preflight (#229, `preflight.py`)          git / remote / base / gh / auth / scopes
  2. mode                                      local-goals or github (github by default when `origin`
                                               is a GitHub owner/repo)
  3. verify command (#228, `verify_detect.py`) confirm by number+id, your own command, or decline
  4. github mode only: labels (#230, `setup.py labels`), assignee `@me`, the board OFFER (#235,
     `board_setup.py create`), and the ledger yes/no
  5. a one-screen summary and the next command

QUESTIONS ARE FLAGS, SO EVERY HOST RUNS THE SAME FLOW. Claude Code asks the user and re-runs with the
answers; Codex and Cursor relay the printed `[ask]` lines, each carrying the exact flag (the shape,
`[ask] <id>: <prose> -> --flag VALUE|VALUE ; --flag ...`, is `ask_line`'s).

CONFIG.JSON IS THE ONE SOURCE OF TRUTH FOR CURRENT STATE (review of PR #286). `.sdlc/state/init.json`
(runtime, git-ignored) records only THAT a question was answered -- so a re-run does not ask it again
-- and never re-applies a value over config.json: a user who later runs `preflight.py local-only` or
edits config.json by hand keeps that choice on every re-run, and the flow says so ("kept ... config.json
wins"). A consequential change -- work off/on, the ledger on, a board created, the source switched --
happens only from a flag on the CURRENT run (or `--yes`, below, for a question nothing has answered).
A remembered repository is never used: `--repo`, else config.json's, else the current `origin`.

`--yes` ANSWERS ONLY WHAT IS SAFE TO DEFAULT AND STILL OPEN: the mode (the detected one) and the ledger
(no), and only where neither a flag nor config.json already answers it -- on a repository configured
before this flow existed it changes nothing and says "kept". A key is open when config.json does not
carry it, or still carries the template value this flow scaffolded AND config.json is byte-for-byte,
mtime-for-mtime what this flow last wrote (the fingerprint in init.json -- see `load_memory`). `--yes`
never answers the board (creates external state -- #235 "never unasked"), the verify command (only the
user knows what proves their repo -- #228), or a `work.enabled` flip (#229 "nothing flips it silently").

EXIT: 0 = every attempted step passed (open `[ask]` questions allowed); 1 = a step FAILED, or preflight
found a blocking problem -- the last line is `Resume: <the exact command>`; 2 = refused before anything
was written (not a git repository, another plugin active, github mode with no repository, bad flags).

Stdlib only. Siblings are loaded by path (the `sdlc_init._preflight` idiom); the agrim-setup and
board CLIs are shelled out to, as `sdlc_init.py` already does.
