"""The guided first-run setup wizard's pure decision logic (issue #1560).

Wraps doctor.check() rather than re-detecting anything -- verified directly, doctor.check() runs
safely against a repo with no .sdlc/ at all and reports it as its own first failing check
("project layer"). This module's only job is CLASSIFICATION (how should a failing check be
handled?) and PERSISTENCE (has the user already said no to this one?) -- never re-implementing
detection doctor.py already owns.

WHY THREE MODES, NOT TWO. "auto_fixable" (we can act, with consent) and "guidance_only" (we can
only describe manual steps) looked sufficient at first, but gh auth login/gh auth refresh are a
real third case: NOT auto-fixable (interactive OAuth, no tool should attempt it), but NOT merely
"guidance" either -- doctor.check() genuinely CAN recheck these afterward, unlike the true
GitHub-UI-only quirks (board view layout) which cannot be checked at all. Collapsing "human must
run one command, then we verify" into "guidance_only" (which offers no recheck) would silently
drop the recheck this plan's own done_when requires. Kept as its own mode: "human_command".

THE HARD REQUIREMENT THIS FILE ENCODES: every step ships a `degraded` string, in the SAME
structure the caller receives -- stating in plain language what does not work while this check
stays unresolved. This is not optional decoration; per this session's explicit product
requirement, no fallback may be presented without stating its cost in the same breath.

    """Imported lazily, inside the function that uses it, not at module load -- doctor.py pulls
    in real subprocess/gh machinery this module's own pure tests must never need. Module-level
    indirection (this wrapper, not a bare `from doctor import check`) is what lets tests
    monkeypatch `setup_wizard._doctor_check` without needing doctor.py importable at all.

    `cheap_only=True` IS NOT OPTIONAL HERE. This wrapper's only caller is `wizard_status()`, whose
    only caller is the UNCONDITIONAL SessionStart hook -- so anything expensive in `doctor.check()`
    is paid once per session, in every repo, forever. Before this feature, every session_start
    behaviour sat behind an opt-in flag; making the wizard unconditional (correctly -- silence was
    the original bug) inherited none of that consent, and `_plugin_versions()` plus the companions
    row spawn the `claude` CLI and curl raw.githubusercontent.com. Measured on a `{}`-config repo,
    same box, same run: 3.82s cold / 3.00s warm for the full check, 0.01s with cheap_only=True.
    (An earlier note here said 3.97s; that was a different sample of the same call.) AGENTS.md's SAFETY
    property is explicit that nothing spawns processes or sends data without the operator opting
    in, so the wizard's own path takes the cheap subset and leaves the full sweep -- network
    included -- to an explicit `/agrim-doctor`, which the user typed on purpose."""

#: Per-check classification, AND the wizard's allow-list. Keyed on doctor.py's own check `name`
#: string -- brittle to a rename over there, but doctor.py's names are user-facing prose already
#: (they're printed verbatim by `/agrim-doctor`), so a rename is a deliberate, visible product
#: decision, not an internal refactor that would silently desync this table.
#:
#: THIS TABLE IS AN ALLOW-LIST, NOT A LOOKUP. `wizard_status()` only ever turns a failing doctor
#: check into a wizard step when its name is a key HERE. That is the difference between a SETUP
#: wizard and a nag: doctor.check() has ~26 checks, and the great majority are ongoing hygiene
#: rows ("team ledger initialized", "hand-off owner roster configured", the census/label-coherence
#: scans, and several whose names embed live-changing values like "dependency markers: ... (3/12
#: open goal(s))"). Letting those fall through to a generic default meant the wizard declared
#: "setup is incomplete, run the wizard before anything else the user asked for" on every mature,
#: perfectly-working repo, forever -- a first-run wizard firing on a repo whose first run was
#: months ago. It also leaked _DEFAULT_MODE's placeholder prose to users, and dismissals could not
#: stick for a check whose name embeds a counter that changes between sessions.
#:
#: The seven below are the genuine first-run setup gaps: things a NEW adopter has not done yet, each
#: with authored, verified "what breaks if you skip this" text. A future check joins the wizard by
#: being added here with that text -- deliberately an explicit act, never automatic.
