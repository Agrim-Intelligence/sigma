description: Goal-Based SDLC - standing discipline for every change (Sigma)
globs:
alwaysApply: true
---

# Goal-Based SDLC (Sigma)

Cursor has no UserPromptSubmit hook, so this always-applied rule is the standing policy. For any
non-trivial or implementation task, do NOT jump straight to coding - follow the phases and state which
one you are on:

1. **Goal** - restate the objective as one concrete, checkable goal.
2. **Research** - blast radius: affected files, existing patterns, constraints.
3. **Plan** - steps, files, tests, definition-of-done.
4. **Plan-Review** - adversarially review the plan BEFORE implementing. Never skip.
5. **Implement** - test-first (red -> green -> refactor); minimal code to pass.
6. **Review** - evidence before claims: run the checks, paste the output; a KPI + qualitative scan.
7. **Retrospective** - capture lessons.

**Intent-aware:** trivial / conversational / read-only requests may be answered directly - but say so
explicitly. The moment it turns into a code change, switch to the spine.

**Never run an irreversible or expensive action** (deploy, delete, overwrite, spend, migrate)
unattended - stop and ask.

**Nobody commits directly to a feature branch. All work reaches it through `sdlc/*` goal
branches.** Concretely: the `sdlc/<goal-id>` branch cut for a goal, then a pull request into
`feature/<name>`. Rebasing a shared branch rewrites published history, which normally forces every
holder to hard-reset; that risk disappears only because nobody is holding commits on it.

What Sigma does is MEASURE the branch before it force-pushes, and refuse to bring it forward
when it finds a commit no pull request accounts for. It checks only on a pick, and only when the
branch is BEHIND its base -- when it skips, it reports nothing at all, so silence is not evidence
the rule held. Sigma cannot stop a direct commit; only branch protection on the host can, and
protecting `feature/*` in the ordinary way blocks the force-push upkeep itself needs, which stops
upkeep entirely. Protect the integration branch; on `feature/*`, grant upkeep's actor a bypass.

**Executors (portable):** this host has no `superpowers` / `code-review` companion, so each phase runs
via Sigma's portable executor - the disciplines in `skills/agrim-*/SKILL.md` (`agrim-brainstorm` ->
Goal, `agrim-plan` -> Plan, `agrim-implement` -> Implement, `agrim-review` + `agrim-verify` -> Review).
Same discipline as the Claude companions, portable.

**Backlog + helpers (optional):** the loop, model-selection, status and KG helpers are plain, zero-dep
`python3` - run them from your Sigma checkout via Cursor's terminal, e.g.
`python3 <sigma>/skills/agrim-loop/scripts/loop.py next .sdlc` or
`python3 <sigma>/skills/agrim-model/scripts/predict.py "<goal>"`.
Status output is the sibling rule `output-contract.mdc`: every status block is constructed by
`python3 <sigma>/skills/agrim-loop/scripts/render.py`, never written by hand.

# Output contract (Sigma)

All status reporting in this repo follows `<sigma>/docs/output-contract.md`, and that document is
the SPECIFICATION of a renderer, not prose to imitate. A status block is CONSTRUCTED by
`<sigma>/skills/agrim-loop/scripts/render.py` from facts you pass it, and never written by hand.
(`<sigma>` is your Sigma checkout; inside the Sigma repository itself it is `.`.)

Three commands, run from Cursor's terminal:

- `python3 <sigma>/skills/agrim-loop/scripts/render.py status|event|decision` -- the facts are one
  JSON object on stdin, or inline as `--json '<facts>'`. `status` builds Block A (STATUS), `event`
  Block B (EVENT), `decision` Block C (DECISION). Relay its stdout exactly as printed.
- `python3 <sigma>/skills/agrim-log/scripts/log.py slots .sdlc` -- the live Block A: one two-line
  slot per active goal, read from the action log and built by render.py. Relay it verbatim; do not
  reword it, re-order it, or add a slot. When it says the log is off or unknown, relay that too.
- `python3 <sigma>/skills/agrim-loop/scripts/phase_report.py end .sdlc <goal> <phase> --pid "$PPID"` -- prints
  Block B at a phase boundary, carrying that phase's measured cost or an honest "unavailable" line.
  Read it; do not restate its numbers or imitate its shape.

A refusal is `render.py: REFUSED [<code>] at <path>: <detail>` on stderr, exit 2, and nothing on
stdout. It means the facts were malformed: fix the facts and run it again. Never patch the prose by
hand, and never emit a block the renderer did not build.

Emit only on a trigger, one block each: work dispatched or a slot refilled (A); a phase boundary
crossed (B); a background task or agent completing (B, then A if slot state changed); a merge
landing (B); a decision needed from the human (C); end of turn with nothing in flight (A). Starting
or finishing a tool call, reading files, thinking and every other intermediate step are not
triggers. If no trigger fires, emit nothing.

Dispatch labels follow the same identity: every subagent label, task title and branch name carries
the goal ref and the phase.

One limit, stated rather than discovered: the constructed line is unforgeable in shape, but it is
not guaranteed to reach the user unparaphrased -- anywhere a reply is read rather than the raw tool
output, it can still be paraphrased -- so relay the block exactly as printed and add nothing around it.

This governs status output only. Content the user explicitly asked for (a report, a walkthrough, an
explanation) is given in full.

## Sigma on Codex

For a non-trivial implementation task, use the installed Sigma skills and run Goal -> Research
-> Plan -> Plan-Review -> Implement -> Review -> Retrospective. Follow each skill's phase gates,
record the evidence, and keep the maker and checker in separate contexts. Read-only and trivial
requests may be answered directly. Use the project `.sdlc/config.json` for optional features.

Codex does not set `CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR`. Before running a Sigma skill command, take the absolute
directory containing that skill's `SKILL.md` from the installed skill path and substitute it for
`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` in that command. Do this for every independent shell call. An empty variable
would point at `/scripts/...`; never execute that unresolved path. Do not infer the plugin's versioned
cache directory from another machine.

Model tiers in the shared ledger are `haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus`, and `fable`. They are relative work
tiers, not Codex model IDs. Before every Codex subagent dispatch, run
`python3 "<absolute agrim-model skill directory>/scripts/predict.py" host-model codex "<tier-or-off>" .sdlc`.
Pass its exact `model=` and `effort=` values to the subagent; never pass an Anthropic tier as a
model ID. If it refuses the mapping, do not dispatch: choose an approved current Codex model in the
affected `model_host_overrides.codex` entry, or update the plugin for a changed host catalog, then
rerun the resolver.

Nobody commits directly to a feature branch. All work reaches it through `sdlc/*` goal branches.
Use the `sdlc/<goal-id>` branch for a goal, then a pull request into `feature/<name>`. Sigma's
check runs only on a pick when that branch is behind its base; silence is not evidence it ran.
Only branch protection can prevent a direct commit. If protecting `feature/*`, grant upkeep's actor
a bypass for its force-push.
