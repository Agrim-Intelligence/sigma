def test_github_rest_issue_fetch_pagination_survives_a_filtered_item_mid_sequence():
    """POST-PR REVIEW FIX: a real bug an independent post-PR reviewer found and reproduced live,
    caught by neither Plan-Review, the pre-PR review, nor any of the ~5700 tests that existed
    before this one -- because none of them combined a MULTI-PAGE fetch with an item the PR filter
    removes. `test_github_rest_issue_fetch_paginates_up_to_the_cap` (above) proves pagination
    across pages; `test_github_rest_issue_fetch_filters_out_pull_requests` (above) proves PR
    filtering; neither proves they compose correctly, and they did not.

    The bug: an earlier version of `_fetch_issues_rest` recomputed `per_page` each iteration as
    `min(_REST_PAGE_SIZE, cap - len(collected))`, using the FILTERED count. GitHub computes a
    request's offset as `(page-1)*per_page` from THAT request's own `per_page` -- so the instant a
    page contained a filtered-out PR, `collected` fell behind the raw fetch count, `per_page`
    shrank, and the next `page=N` silently re-indexed into the WRONG raw offset. Reproduced live
    exactly as this fixture does it (a backlog spanning >2 pages with one PR-shaped item on the
    first page): the result looked complete (still `cap` items, no error) but silently DUPLICATED
    an early issue and DROPPED the true next-oldest one beyond the window -- no exception, no
    `read_degraded()` signal, indistinguishable from a correct read without checking every number.

    This fixture's fake computes each response from the REQUEST's own `page`/`per_page` fields
    (real GitHub REST offset semantics: `start = (page-1)*per_page`), not from a running index the
    fake itself tracks -- a fake that tracked its own position would paper over exactly this bug,
    since it would ignore whatever (wrong) page/per_page the code asked for. One PR-shaped item
    sits at raw position 50 (comfortably inside page 1 of 100), and the backlog is deep enough
    (220 raw items) to force 3 real pages even after the one filtered item, so a regression here
    fails whether the shrinkage happens on page 2 or page 3."""
