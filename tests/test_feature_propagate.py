"""feature_propagate.py -- the registry entry copied to sibling repos, one-directionally
(#1477, epic #1464, story #1427).

#1473 records a goal under its unit in THIS repo. This is the half that reaches the OTHER ones:
§7.1 requires every participating repo to carry the WHOLE entry -- both repos' branches and both
repos' goals -- so that somebody who later loses access to one repo still sees the whole picture
instead of half of it.

THREE PROPERTIES, AND EACH IS A SEPARATE CLASS OF TEST HERE:

  1. THE COPY IS WHOLE. `feature_registry.write_unit` replaces a unit's entry rather than merging
     it, so a half entry is not merely lossy -- it ERASES. Both directions are pinned: a shard
     written on the pick path must not erase the chart sheet's other repos, and a document
     propagated into a sibling must not erase the goals that sibling recorded itself.
  2. DISCOVERY FLOWS ONE WAY. Propagation reaches the repos `repos` already names. A goal picked in
     a repo that is NOT named is a scope expansion -- the unit owner's decision -- so it lands inert
     with a ledger entry to that owner and `repos` is UNCHANGED. The registry refusal and the
     `sdlc:needs-confirmation` overlay are asserted separately, because they live in different
     layers and either one alone is the bug.
  3. MISSING ACCESS LOSES NOTHING AND BLOCKS NOTHING. A sibling that cannot be written is ledgered
     to that repo's owner, the local end still lands, and the pick carries on.

WRITTEN AGAINST A MUTATION RUN, inheriting `tests/test_feature_sync.py`'s discipline whole:
`_mod_with` asserts its target exists and replaces EVERY occurrence, and every mutation test asserts
the mutant's BEHAVIOUR differs on a concrete input rather than merely that the suite went red.
