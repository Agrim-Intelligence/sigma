"""#954: `work.py start` must not refuse on the registry files its own sync wrote, and must still
refuse on everything else.

`_dirty_root_refusal` (#2014) refuses a start while the ROOT checkout carries tracked, uncommitted
edits on `work.base`. Once a human commits `.sdlc/features/` (branching-model §14 step 3 says to),
every later pick's registry sync rewrites `units/<unit>.json` and `<unit>.md` in that root -- so the
NEXT start refused on Sigma's own write and told the operator to shelve it with git's own shelving
command, which is how 17 shelved changes buried real work.

The fix exempts a registry file only when its current bytes AND its committed bytes are both in
Sigma's own recorded write chain (`feature_provenance`). These tests drive real git end to end
(tests/registry_root.py) except where a fake runner is the only way to pin a call shape.

Every body runs inside `registry_root.drained(capfd)`: one captured-output section anywhere in a
verify run voids every red that run would record (plan §7, measured).
