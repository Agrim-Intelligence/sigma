def test_cli_release_does_not_consume_the_iteration_budget():
    """Mirrors test_cli_start_next_record_and_budget's own end-to-end shape. A goal that was
    claimed and then released must not count against budget.max_iterations — it was never
    actually worked, so a fresh `next` right after the release must still return a real goal
    (not BUDGET), and the run's one real iteration is still available for whichever goal
    actually gets recorded done.

    POST-REVIEW FIX (PR #1107, Finding 4): `_backlog()`'s config carries no `ledger` key, so
    `ledger.enabled(config)` was False and the claim-lease gate in `_next()` never engaged — the
    released goal was "pickable again" here purely because LocalSource's file-status-based
    discovery re-offers any `status: pending` goal regardless of the ledger, which release's
    status flip alone already guarantees. Turning the ledger on (explicit `actor`, so this never
    shells out to the real `gh`) is necessary but NOT sufficient on its own: every `next`/`release`
    call here is a SEPARATE subprocess, so `claim_belongs_to_me`'s dead-writer-of-my-own-actor
    fallback (#374) would reclaim the goal for the second `next` regardless of whether release ever
    touched the ledger at all (confirmed: this assertion alone still passed with `_held()`
    temporarily reverted to not recognize the `release` kind). The line that actually closes the
    gap is the direct `open_claims` check below, right after `release` and before the second
    `next` — it reads the shared ledger view the same way `_next()` itself does, with no pid-
    liveness fallback to mask a broken `_held()`."""

    test means to prove. Passing DISTINCT `--session-pid` values (matching the shipped `/agrim-loop`
    skill's own real pattern: every session captures and threads its OWN stable id, see SKILL.md's
    `--session-pid "$PPID"` on every `start`/`next`/`next-batch` call) is what makes two

    `ledger._held()` unit level -- see `test_a_stale_reclaimed_actor_release_does_not_wipe_the_
    same_actors_live_reclaim_by_another_run` in tests/test_ledger.py for that half). This sweep
    (`_auto_reclaim_stale_claims`) snapshots `ledger.expired_claims()`, THEN calls
    `_goal_has_registered_worker` (#1284: the per-goal check the sweep now uses, same as
    `_claimed_goal_has_live_worker` before it -- a real `gh`-touching check, non-instant) before it finally
    writes its `release(reclaimed_actor=...)` entry -- a genuine window. This reproduces amy's own
    OTHER live process legitimately re-claiming the goal, under a NEW `run_id`, inside that exact
    window: the live-worker check is monkeypatched to append a fresh `claimed` entry (run 'run-2',
    actor 'amy' -- a SEPARATE physical process's own config, deliberately NOT the sweep's own
    `cfg`, exactly as a genuinely concurrent process would use its own) as a side effect before
    returning `False` ('no live-worker MARKER, proceed to release') -- deterministic stand-in for
    the timing-dependent race the review names as 'not hypothetical', since two concurrent
    sessions sharing one login is this repo's own concurrent-drain shape. The sweep itself runs as
    a DIFFERENT nominal actor ('sweep-actor', matching the established alice/bob convention
    `test_auto_reclaim_durably_clears_a_different_actors_stale_claim` above already uses) so this
    isolates the `reclaimed_actor`/`reclaimed_run` branch specifically, not the primary
    (actor, run)-scoped branch `test_two_concurrent_processes_of_the_same_actor_do_not_race_via_a_
    stale_terminal_entry` (tests/test_ledger.py) already covers. The sweep must still release the
    STALE lease (run-1) -- it has no way to know a race happened -- but the release it writes must
    name that stale run as `reclaimed_run`, so `ledger._held()` leaves run-2's live reclaim

    _session_in_flight_goals(...)` -- with BOTH #1199's session-registry skip and #1198's
    auto-reclaim cooldown skip populated in the SAME call, proving they compose rather than one
    silently shadowing the other.

    Deliberately does NOT drive this through a real GitHub-backed `_auto_reclaim_stale_claims` --
    that function's own live-worker corroboration (per-goal vs. goal-agnostic) is separately
    tested end to end by `test_auto_reclaim_sweep_reclaims_past_an_unrelated_live_session` and
    `test_auto_reclaim_sweep_still_blocked_by_a_live_worker_on_the_same_goal` (below; #1284 --
    as of that fix, a goal-agnostic live session like the one registered here no longer blocks
    reclaim of an unrelated goal at all, so this test's cooldown/skip-set union would no longer
    even need the stub to pass; it stays stubbed anyway so this test keeps isolating exactly what
    THIS rebase wrote -- the union itself -- from the separately-tested internals of what feeds
    it, rather than depending on `_auto_reclaim_stale_claims`'s own behavior).

    Three goals, three fates in the SAME `_next()` call: `goal_reclaimed` is withheld by the
    (stubbed) reclaim cooldown, `goal_in_flight` is withheld because a live SIBLING session already
    has it registered, and `goal_free` -- encumbered by neither -- is the one actually returned."""

    hardcoding it here a second time -- this test's own job is narrower: prove the MECHANICS
    genuinely work when invoked exactly as SKILL.md now instructs, through `main()`'s real CLI
    dispatch, not the Python-level helpers directly.

    AC5's "by default" now means from the SKILL's perspective, not the bare-CLI-flag perspective:
    an operator following SKILL.md never hand-adds anything beyond what the skill's own prompt text
    already gives them ($PPID, read fresh from their own shell each call) -- there is no path
    through the shipped skill where registration is skipped. That is still "no hand-added flag
    required" in the sense the original acceptance criterion meant, even though it is not
    flag-free at the raw `loop.py` CLI level (see `test_cli_start_without_session_pid_flag_still_

    (this pytest process), stable across calls, unlike `os.getppid()` read one level deeper from
    inside the spawned `loop.py` process.

    Verified both ways directly against the two `loop.py` states this repo actually has: run
    unchanged against the pre-fix `next`/`next-batch` CLI dispatch (drops `--session-pid` on the
    floor, `_next` falls back to ITS OWN unstable `os.getppid()`), the second `next` call

    -- the OR'd, GOAL-AGNOSTIC signal #1197's own correction had already moved `_next()`'s and
    `work.py`'s reclaim-refusal call sites OFF of, specifically because it lets one unrelated live
    session block a DIFFERENT goal's reclaim forever (see that correction's own commit message and
    `_claimed_goal_has_live_worker`'s docstring). #1198 merged before #1197's correction existed
    and was never updated to match it, so the sweep carried the SAME hole on its own release side,
    just reached via wall-clock TTL age instead of a dead-picker-pid misread.

    This mattered MORE after #1199 than before it: #1199's SKILL.md has every ordinary
    `/agrim-loop` call pass `--session-pid "$PPID"`, so a live, correctly-registered session is the
    NORMAL running state, not an edge case -- meaning the sweep was routinely inert for the whole

    `_fetch_pending` (sources.py) unconditionally excludes any issue still carrying
    `in_progress_label`, and this sweep is the ONLY thing that clears that label after a crash --
    so the practical effect was a crashed goal going invisible to the picker for as long as the
    unrelated session ran anything at all.

    #1284 closes the gap by switching `_auto_reclaim_stale_claims` to the narrower

    of an unrelated, genuinely crashed goal. See

# FILE it leaves behind on disk carried nothing (0 bytes forever), so a reader who cannot re-attempt
# the flock themselves (a human, a different tool) had no way to tell "claimed and abandoned" from
# "claimed and working" from the file alone -- reported live 2026-08-07: a session stood down rather
# than guess, and clearing the orphaned locks by hand was the only way forward.
#
# PR #1108 review: the first cut of this fix stamped the WINNING PROCESS's own os.getpid() and read
# it back with the same session_active/agent_alive two-signal combination (ledger.pid_alive() OR
# the file's own mtime past the TTL). That looked right against every test below -- because every
# one of them checked liveness from the SAME still-running process that had just won the lock. In
# production that process is always the short-lived `next`/`next-batch` CLI invocation, which exits
# within moments of returning (see session_start's own docstring) -- long before a dispatched
# subagent's real, multi-hour work even starts. So ledger.pid_alive() on the stamped pid reads
# "dead" within a fraction of a second of EVERY acquisition, worked or abandoned alike; empirically
# reproduced below with a real subprocess that wins the lock and exits normally, checked from a
# separate, still-running process. Fixed by cross-checking agent_alive/session_active -- the two
# markers that already correctly track a genuine long-lived pid -- before ever trusting the claim
