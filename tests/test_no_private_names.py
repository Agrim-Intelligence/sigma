"""Strict guard for private names in the core's surface (S1-G1; tests/ since #2580; strict since
#2584).

Scans the core's surface for the private-name patterns in `_PATTERNS` below (PRD Appendix B). There
is NO baseline file and, since #2706, no exemption list: the scan must find nothing. No command
writes an exemption, so a new finding cannot be accepted by regeneration -- only by rewording it
(#2584 owner rulings 1 and 3). Every failure message ends with
`Recheck: python3 tests/test_no_private_names.py`.

WHAT IS SCANNED: the public surface, `tests/public_surface.py` -- in this repository, the files
`tools/public-manifest.txt` selects (tests/ included since #2580, owner decision D3); in a public
tree, every tracked file (#2584). `_scanned_paths()` is the one generator of scanned files, and
the cross-boundary and network guards read the same surface.

PATTERNS: `_PATTERNS` below (PRD Appendix B). They are not restated here, because a restatement
is a second copy that drifts -- and, since tests/ is scanned, one this guard would flag. They match
case-insensitively, except where a pattern says otherwise with `(?-i:...)` (the env-var pattern,
as Appendix B specifies, since #2584). NOT HERE: Appendix B's server hostnames (those in the
private deploy docs and configs) -- a hostname list is an internal-address scan, which S2-G1
(#2586) owns; this guard does not claim it.

RETIRED NAMES (#2729, PRD Q1-G0, D11): the brand and skill prefix this core shipped under before
`sigma`/`agrim-*` are private names now -- the old brand token, its `_`-suffixed env-var prefix,
the 42 old skill names, the old skill-namespace glob (the old prefix followed by `*`: always the
namespace, never a branch -- a branch glob is `sdlc/*`), the old `<...-dir>` usage placeholder, the
old repository name and (D12, post-PR review) the old personal-account owner slug in front of the new
repository name, which the mechanical rebrand minted and which names a repository that does not
exist -- each spelled in `_PATTERNS` from adjacent string fragments, which the parser folds into one literal, so
no shipped line (this file's included) carries one whole. The ONLY exemption: the ops-branch names
`sdlc-ledger` and `sdlc-knowledge`, and only on a line that names the branch (`branch`, `origin/`,
`refs/heads/`; `_sdlc_ledger_disposition`) -- after `name:`, after a bare `/`, under `skills/` or
in a heading the same token is the retired skill and is flagged.

EXEMPTIONS, two kinds and no others:
  1. EXACT PHRASES (`_EXEMPTIONS`): a phrase exempts itself and nothing else on its line (#2584;
     until then it exempted the whole line, hiding anything written beside it). The structured
     scan exempts a match only when it lies wholly inside a phrase span; the raw-word comparator
     reads the line with each phrase masked (`_mask_exemptions`).
  2. PATTERN-LIST SPANS (`_PATTERN_LIST_SPANS`): a guard must spell a private name to do its job,
     so per guard file the NAMES of the top-level assignments holding its pattern lists are listed,
     and only those assignments' own code lines are exempt. `_pattern_list_lines` finds them with
     `ast`, so a span follows edits and no line number is pinned. A listed name that is missing,
     assigned twice, or sharing a line with any other top-level statement raises `ExemptionDrift`
     -- loud, never a silent widening. Everything else in a guard file is scanned like any other
     test file, so a guard's plants are DERIVED from its listed constants, never spelled.
(A third kind, the one-release alias lines #2584 owner ruling 2 kept as named survivors, went with
the aliases themselves in #2706, which superseded that ruling.)
The raw-word comparator (`_RAW_ROOTS`, `RAW_RESIDUAL_SHIPPED`, `RAW_RESIDUAL_TESTS`) reads the same
files and spans, with each phrase masked (the structured scan uses span containment instead); its
pins are reviewed in-code counts, not a baseline.

DOCSTRING NOTES: This guard uses text scanning, not AST, for the scan itself. This is correct
because:
  1. We need to catch private names in docstrings, config files, templates, and docs
  2. Exemptions by exact phrase only (not by file) prevent false negatives from bypass attempts
  3. The exemptions are narrow and easy to audit (three exact strings per the PRD)
(`ast` is used for one thing only: locating a guard file's pattern-list spans.)

THE SCRIPT GESTURE: `python3 tests/test_no_private_names.py` takes NO arguments (any argument,
`--write-baseline` included, exits 2 and writes nothing). It runs EVERY zero-argument test in this
file, printing `ran: <name>` before each -- a strict test that gained a fixture parameter would
silently stop running, and the missing line shows it -- and ends with one line:
`test_no_private_names: OK|FAIL (<k> finding(s) over <n> scanned file(s))`, exit 0 or 1.

    config that still holds one reads exactly as if it did not: nothing is migrated, and nothing is
    said about the old key, with ONE exception: #2738 (Q1-G9) says the journal's own pre-rename
    block out loud -- a suffix on the `/agrim-doctor features` journal row telling the operator to
    move the value -- while still migrating and aliasing nothing. Its source spells that key from
    fragments (`doctor._LEGACY_JOURNAL_BLOCK`), so no shipped line carries it whole.

    Each key alone carries a block that the old aliases would have honoured (`enabled: true` AND a
    `project_id`). The journal switch, an actual journal write through `ledger.append` (the path
    every emitter takes, so a read re-added at its own gate is caught too), adoption, every
    `/agrim-doctor features` row and the `managed settings` check row must read byte-for-byte as
    they do for `{}`, except that one key's journal row, which must read as the `{}` row plus the
    exact note and nothing else. Non-vacuous both ways: the key set is non-empty and every key is
    one the scan forbids, and the SAME block under the core's own keys does change what is seen --
    so the comparison can go red.

    Hermetic: every probe `run` answers "unavailable", every DI path points into the temporary
    directory, `cheap_only` skips the plugin CLI and the network, and the doctor's one real child
    process (`reviewer.py resolve`, 10 s timeout) is stubbed on this private module copy -- so a
    timeout under load cannot make one call differ from its baseline. The `append` call pins
    `ledger.actor`: without it the positive control resolves the writer through a live `gh api
    user` call, which pytest's `_no_live_gh` guard would block but the script gesture would make."""
