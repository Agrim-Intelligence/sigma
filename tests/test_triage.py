    bucket item's "number", which local items never have -- see `_survey_edges`'s own docstring,
    "plan's own domain is GitHub issue numbers only"). `extra_index` is `compile_plan`'s own

    discovery). Note `priority_of` itself returns an already-RANKED int (0-4, or UNPRIORITISED),
    not the raw label -- so the fix stores the raw frontmatter value (what every other bucket's own
    "priority" field already holds, and what `discovery.priority_rank`/`_priority_rank` downstream
    expect to rank themselves), and this test proves the two readings agree rather than assigning
    `priority_of`'s own return value into the item (which would hand `schedule_waves` an int it
