"""`sigma-define` -- the skill that OPENS a unit of work (#1662, story #1427, epic #1464).

Every other module on this epic READS a declaration or acts on one. This one is the first that
CREATES the thing being declared, which puts it on the far side of three rules the rest of the kit
states from the other direction, and each test below exists because breaking one of them is a bug
this repo has already shipped and fixed:

  - THE STEP ORDER IS THE FEATURE (§14). Branch, then label, then registry, then declare. A body
    marker whose label does not yet exist REFUSES the pick and sets the goal aside -- measured
    twice, on a repository with no registry at all. So the order is asserted as data (`_STEPS`) AND
    as observed call order, and both directions of "a failing step stops the ones after it" are
    pinned. A guard that only checked the happy path would pass against an implementation that ran
    all three steps regardless and reported the first failure at the end.
  - THE TYPE IS METADATA, NEVER A PREFIX (§2/§5). All three types produce `feature/<name>`, because
    base resolution matches on that one prefix, and a branch carrying a per-kind one instead would
    be invisible to it.
  - THERE IS EXACTLY ONE DEFINITION OF WHAT A UNIT IS CALLED (`features._is_unit_name`). Asserted by
    OBJECT IDENTITY rather than by a behaviour table, because a table can be satisfied by a faithful
    copy -- and a faithful copy is precisely what drifts later. The table is kept as well, but it is
    the identity assertion that makes a second predicate impossible rather than merely unlikely.

THE ONE RULE THIS MODULE IS ALLOWED TO BREAK, PINNED AS A TEST RATHER THAN AS PROSE. Sigma never
creates a `feature:*` label; `sources.GitHubSource._run` refuses that exact invocation at the single
chokepoint every `gh` call in that class passes through. `sigma-define` is the human's own gesture, so
it is the one authorized exception -- and `test_the_label_create_is_exactly_the_shape_the_kit_refuses`
proves the exception is real by feeding this module's own argv to the kit's own refusal predicate. A
comment claiming the exception would be worth nothing; a test that FAILS if the two ever stop
describing the same call is worth something.

Hermetic throughout: no `git`, no `gh`, no network, no live branch/label/issue. The runner is
injected (`run=`), the same `(cwd, argv) -> stdout` contract `feature_sync._run`, `feature_rebase`
and `work._run` all share, so a runner written here could be handed to any of them unchanged.
