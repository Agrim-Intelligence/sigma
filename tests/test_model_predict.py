# with no wildcard between them; the word "full" sits exactly there and prevents a match, so
# "Run the full test suite and confirm green" fell through to the medium default. An earlier draft
# of this fix read the issue's own "-> effort medium, not low" as documenting that CORRECT,
# already-existing behavior and shipped only a pinning test -- technically accurate about what
# unpatched code returns, but wrong about which side of medium/low the issue actually wants: a
# fresh, independent code-review re-read "which the word 'full' breaks" as naming a DEFECT (the
# rule failing to recognize a full-suite run as the same mechanical, low-effort action a partial
# run already is), not a documented feature to preserve -- and the issue's own Definition of Done
# ("each test is seen RED against the current pattern before the fix lands") is literally
# unsatisfiable under the "already correct" reading, which is itself evidence that reading was
# wrong. This is also the more principled answer under this file's OWN documented effort-axis
# philosophy (see `_EFFORT_PATTERNS`' module comment above): effort measures REASONING difficulty,
# not scope -- running the FULL suite requires no more reasoning than running a subset, the same
# way a one-line payment fix is opus-tier but still only medium effort. Fixed by widening the
