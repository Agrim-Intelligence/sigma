"""Real-git end-to-end proof for #1890: `loop.py verify` must detect and auto-rebase a worktree
that has drifted behind its own base BEFORE running anything expensive against it, and must
refuse -- never silently proceed -- when the auto-rebase itself cannot apply cleanly.

Deliberately NOT mocked. This repo's own standing rule (AGENTS.md) is that an untested guard is
decoration, and a test that only checks a function's return value proves nothing about whether the
underlying git state actually changed -- exactly the gap independent plan-review exploited to find
a real bug in the first draft of this fix (a rebase that "succeeded" while leaving conflict markers
in a tracked file). These tests use real `git` subprocesses and assert on the ACTUAL repository
state afterward, not just a return value.

Uses plain `git clone`s rather than `git worktree add` linked worktrees: every git operation this
code issues (fetch, rev-list, rebase, push) behaves identically either way, and a linked worktree
would add ceremony without changing what is under test.

# after the dossier and the plan are already written against stale code.
#
# The refusal is an ESCALATION, not one verdict, and the three tables below are its controls:
#   conflict (any occurrence)      -> park     a human must resolve it; self-healing is impossible
#   transient, 1st consecutive     -> release  a blip self-heals on the next pick, costs no budget

#   a check that passes            -> reset    the bound is on CONSECUTIVE failures, not a tally
# Parking every refusal strands a goal on a network blip (`sdlc:parked` is never auto-resumed);
# releasing every transient recreates `run_loop`'s own documented `poisoned` spin -- pick, claim,
# start, release, pick -- burning gh calls while consuming zero budget, because `_release`
# deliberately never advances the cursor. Only the escalation is both recoverable and bounded.

#
# `state.done_refusal` gates `record done` (loop.py's dispatch) and `work.py merge` (its own
# pre-gate call) on the verify evidence file. Before this section it read exit-0, `at` vs this
# run's start, and `run` -- three facts about WHEN and WHO, and none about WHAT was verified. So a
# worktree edited after a green verify still satisfied the gate: the review-fix cycle SKILL.md
# itself prescribes ("fix them in the worktree ... re-run `loop.py verify`") had nothing enforcing
# its second half.
#
# The evidence already carried `head` -- and `head` cannot be the answer. Measured on this repo's
# own live evidence when #1897 was written, goals 1933/1934/1935/1936/1937/1962 all recorded the
# SAME `head`, because SKILL.md's order is verify -> commit -> pr -> review -> merge -> record done:
# at verify time the whole change is UNCOMMITTED and `head` is just the shared base. Comparing it
# at `record done`, after `work.py commit` moved HEAD, would refuse every goal ever.
#
# So the fingerprint is the goal's OWN CHANGE relative to `merge-base(HEAD, <remote>/<base>)`, which
# is the one formulation that survives all three legitimate mutations (commit, fetch, clean rebase)
# and still catches an edit. Every one of those is a control below, and each was seen RED against
# the pre-#1897 code before being trusted.
