# different one (e.g. the eventual real backlog-empty after two budget stops). Keying on the PAIR
# instead -- run_started_at is written fresh by `start_run` at the top of every `/sigma-loop`
# invocation, including every relaunch -- makes a relaunch's own terminal event claim independently

    on session A's green. That silent inheritance is precisely what #889 was filed to stop
