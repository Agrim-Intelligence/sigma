"""#1074 -- every test that reads CHANGELOG.md survives a release commit.

THE CHANGELOG READERS (audited; "survives" = still green after `simulate_release`, once or twice):
  test_upkeep_pins.test_changelog_entry            survives (reads the whole file; was: Unreleased + one section, broke at the 2nd release)
  test_bk_gate (slice 5 entry)                     survives (reads the whole file; was: text above the 1.0.4 heading)
  test_readiness_decide._changelog_entry           survives (any section)
  test_known_false_claims.test_changelog_versions_are_dated   survives (headings only)
  test_release_consistency heading pin             survives (headings only; Unreleased skipped)
  test_release_notes.test_shipped_*                survives (extracts one named version)
  test_manifests first-release-heading pin         survives (skips `## Unreleased`)
Fixture-only readers (tmp_path changelogs in test_feature_rebase, test_union_headed, test_rebase_brief,
test_rename_tools, test_work, ...) never read the shipped file and are not affected.
Ignore-lists that merely skip the file (test_skill_structure, test_readme_first_run, ...) are not pins.
