# Measured on the 2026-09-01 validation run (story #2017 -> epic #2020 -> slices #2021-#2026): the
# `goal-review` pass wrote an explicit `"priority": "P2"` into ALL SIX child entries, which
# `docs/dossier-pipeline.md` §7f forbids in as many words. `compile_plan.py` did exactly what it was
# told -- the rule was honour-system prose, so nothing detected the deviation and it lands as a real
# `priority:P<n>` label AND, on a project-enabled repo, a real board field. A team then cannot tell
# which of its P2s a human set.
#
# REFUSE, not strip -- the same adjudication #1956 made for a design-artifact id (CHANGELOG: of the
# two routes, "resolving it ... could only mean ... dropping it, which is the bug moved into code
# where it is harder to see"). A strip produces a board that looks right while the model never
# learns, and silently discards a real `P0`.
#
# OPT-IN, because `compile_plan.py` is shared: `skills/agrim-scope/SKILL.md` mandates "a real
# `P0`-`P4` priority" per issue on the agrim-scope path, and `scope.py` calls the same function. The
# Dossier path opts in -- and because a flag alone is one more honour-system rule, the CLI also
# turns the guard on from the plan's own contractual directory.
