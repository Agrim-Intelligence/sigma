"""feature_rebase.py -- rebase upkeep for a long-lived feature branch (#1476, epic #1464).

L3 of the branching model. `work.rebase()` already replays a GOAL branch, which has a worktree and
a record; the new thing here is the FEATURE branch, which has neither. Two levels, in order:
integration branch -> feature, then the feature's goal branches onto the rebased feature.

WHY THESE TESTS RUN REAL `git` RATHER THAN AN INJECTED RUNNER. Every other module on this epic is
tested with a fake runner, correctly: they ask git questions and act on the answers, and the
answers are the interesting part. This one FORCE-PUSHES A SHARED BRANCH, which is the single most
destructive operation in the epic, and the three properties that make it safe are properties of
git itself, not of this code:

  * a conflict aborts and leaves BOTH repositories exactly as they were -- no half-applied rebase,
    no stranded worktree, and a remote tip byte-identical to the one measured before;
  * a STALE lease REFUSES rather than overwrites;
  * `--first-parent` is what tells a squash-merge landing apart from a commit somebody typed
    straight onto the branch.

A fake runner asserts what this module BELIEVES about git. Only real git asserts what git does. So
the fixture below builds a throwaway bare "remote" and a real checkout in `tmp_path`, and the
destructive assertions are made against measured shas.

THE ISSUE-FILING EDGE IS INJECTED, because `handoff.create_tracked_issue` opens a real GitHub
issue. `_filer()` captures its arguments so the "a conflict files an issue NAMING THE TWO BRANCHES"
clause of the definition of done is asserted on the text that would have been filed.

WRITTEN AGAINST A MUTATION RUN -- 18 mutants, each probe-gated (proved to behave differently from
HEAD on a concrete input BEFORE the suite was consulted), 17 killed. The eighteenth is the reason
`_rebase_feature` no longer calls `rebase --abort`: its probe measured no behavioural difference at
all, because the `finally` throws the whole worktree away. There is deliberately no `_mod_with`
helper here -- the run was driven from outside the suite so that a harness killed mid-write could
restore the source, which an in-process substitution cannot promise.

    """#278 (non-blocking note on #144): `work.rebase()` force-pushes a GOAL branch after the same
    kind of replay. Single-writer, but the same data-loss shape: the goal's commit reached the
    feature branch as a patch-equivalent copy (a rebase-merge) and was then reverted there, so `git
    rebase` skips it as "already upstream" and the replay silently loses the goal's 300 lines. The
    guard refuses: nothing pushed, the worktree put back at its pre-rebase head."""
