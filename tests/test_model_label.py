"""`model:*` is an adopter's own annotation, not a kit vocabulary — pinned as such (#1602).

Triage's hygiene bucket used to flag every in-scope goal that carried no `model:*` label, and the
`sigma-triage` SKILL presented that as a gap to close before picking. Nothing answered the only
question that raises: *which values are legal?* The kit creates nine labels, all `sdlc:*`
lifecycle (`test_the_kit_creates_only_the_nine_lifecycle_labels`); `docs/label-model.md` did not
mention the prefix; and the kit's own two hardcoded values contradicted each other and everything
else — `model:daily` on every decompose meta-issue, `model:bulk` in the README's copy-paste example,
neither defined anywhere, while `predict.py`'s tiers are `haiku | sonnet | opus | fable`.

THE DIRECTION TAKEN, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE OTHER ONE. The alternative was to define the vocabulary:
write the four tiers into `docs/label-model.md` and translate the kit's two stragglers into it. That
fails on a fact `test_the_tier_is_a_function_of_the_goal_text_alone` measures — **no label value
reaches model selection at all.** `predict.predict()` takes goal TEXT and nothing else; the gate is
`model_selection: "auto"` in config; `_label_value` reads `model:` only so triage can print a column.
Publishing a value set in the file whose whole job is "what each label MEANS" would therefore assert,
in the contract document, that setting `model:opus` runs a goal on opus. It does not. That is the
same defect as #1600 — a doc describing something the code does not do — committed fresh, in the one
place readers are entitled to trust. So the demand goes instead, and the doc says what is true.

A hygiene check is a claim that an issue is not enqueue-ready. `priority:*` earns that: triage reads
it and orders waves by it, so it stays demanded (`test_hygiene_still_demands_priority`). `model:*`
does not: the enqueue path, the pick path and the tier prediction all run identically without it.
Demanding it manufactured an obligation with no payoff, and the field result is what an unpayable
obligation always produces — one adopter board grew `model:sonnet`, `model:haiku` and `model:daily`,
this repo's grew five values, none agreeing with each other or with `predict.py`.

What deliberately SURVIVES is the pass-through: a human who puts a model value in a triage plan
still gets it attached (`test_a_human_authored_plan_still_attaches_its_model_value`). The kit takes
no position on the vocabulary — which is exactly why it must not demand one, and must not stop an
adopter who has one of their own.
