"""#1499: a goal whose declared prerequisite is still OPEN must never be CLAIMED.

THE SHAPE THAT WAS BROKEN, measured live on 1.4.1 (`7094e6c0`) against a real board:

    backlog: #1594 (no marker), #1595 and #1596 (both "**Blocked by:** #1594")
    pick 1 -> 1594   correct
    pick 2 -> 1595   #1594 still OPEN and in progress
    pick 3 -> 1595   again
    pick 4 -> 1596   #1594 still OPEN

Every pick after the first returned a goal that could not be worked, so a human had to `--skip`
each one by hand on every call. On a dependency graph the loop did not degrade — it STALLED. The
dependency data was there the whole time: the board mirror had already stored
`{"phrase": "blocked by", "ref": "1594"}` on #1595's record at fetch time. Nothing read it before
the claim. `precheck` reads it, but `precheck` runs AFTER `mark_in_progress`, and on the shipped
`backlog_check.action: "flag"` it only annotates.

WHY THE FIX IS A SKIP AND NOT A PARK. `_next()` leaves a held goal exactly as it found it —
`sdlc:goal` intact, no `sdlc:in-progress`, no claim lock, no comment, no ledger line — and moves to
the next candidate. It becomes pickable by itself the moment its blocker closes; nothing has to
unpark it and no human has to intervene. That is why the assertions below check for the ABSENCE of
writes as hard as they check the pick.

WHAT THE GATE READS, AND WHAT IT COSTS. The board mirror, off disk. `mirror.fetch_and_write` is
TTL-guarded, so a repo whose mirror is fresh pays ZERO `gh` calls for the gate WHENEVER NOTHING IS
HELD (`test_a_fresh_mirror_costs_the_gate_no_gh_calls_when_nothing_is_held`) — which is every pick
on a backlog with no open dependency edge.

TWO THINGS BUY A REFETCH, and this paragraph named only the first until #1650 (it also named the
first test by a name it no longer has, which is why the citations below are checked):

  * the `goal_not_in_corpus` hole — a mirror fresh by TTL but written before the issues being picked
    existed — forces one refresh, at most once per PROCESS
    (`test_the_forced_refresh_happens_at_most_once_per_process`);
  * #1650: reporting a HOLD forces one refresh, at most once per CALL however many goals are held,
    and never when the call already fetched live
    (`test_the_hold_refresh_is_paid_once_per_call_however_many_goals_are_held`,
    `test_the_absence_refresh_and_the_hold_refresh_are_never_both_paid_in_one_call`). It is NOT
    bounded per process: a blocker that closes between two picks has to be seen by the second.

So the mirror is read once per call plus at most one refresh, not "once per call" flat
(`test_the_mirror_is_read_once_per_pick_plus_at_most_one_refresh`).

FAIL OPEN, LOUDLY. Every state the gate cannot determine — no mirror, a goal still absent after the
refresh, a prerequisite the mirror does not carry — CLAIMS, because a wrongly-held goal stalls the
loop, which is the bug this file exists to close. None of them is silent: each prints why.
