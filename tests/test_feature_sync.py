"""feature_sync.py -- the pick-path registry sync (#1473, epic #1464, story #1427).

`feature_registry` (#1469) is the store and `feature_doc` (#1470) is the human-readable half. This
is the thing that RUNS: on every goal pick it records the goal under the unit its issue declares,
cross-checks what the registry claims against the branches that actually exist, and brings
`<name>.md` into line. The design's own sentence is the spec -- "live state comes from the remote;
history survives locally; NEITHER IS TRUSTED ALONE" -- and each half of it is a separate class of
test here.

THE ONE REQUIREMENT THAT IS NOT ABOUT CORRECTNESS-ON-ONE-INPUT. Recording a goal under its unit is
a read-modify-write of ONE shard, and #1469 measured a bare one losing 6-8 of 10 goal numbers across
10 real processes -- never corrupt, just silently absent, which is worse than a crash. Two goals on
one unit picked at once is not an exotic case: it is what a feature in flight IS, and what a
parallel drain produces by design. So the headline test here spawns REAL SUBPROCESSES -- not threads,
which share a GIL and an interpreter and would prove nothing about `os.replace` racing itself -- and
asserts that not one goal number is lost. A test that passed on threads and failed on processes is
exactly the shape of the bug being fixed.

WHAT IS ASSERTED, AND WHY IT IS ASSERTED THAT WAY:

  1. the four definition-of-done clauses, each on its own: idempotent append, unknown unit creates
     BOTH entry and file, a branch that no longer exists is reconciled AND surfaced, an emptied unit
     is closed and its file survives;
  2. IGNORANCE IS NEVER RECONCILED. A remote that could not be read reconciles nothing at all --
     "the branch list came back empty" and "there are no branches" are different facts, and reading
     the first as the second deletes every branch in the registry at once;
  3. the pick path adds NO second issue read. Asserted against the recorded command list of a real
     `work.start()`, because the only honest form of "we did not ask twice" is counting the asks;
  4. the pick path never writes `index.json`. Asserted on the file's BYTES, because the whole point
     of the shard layout is that concurrent picks stop rewriting one shared file;
  5. nothing here can break a pick. A sync that raises must cost the registry, never the goal.

WRITTEN AGAINST A MUTATION RUN, with `tests/test_feature_registry.py`'s discipline inherited whole:
`_mod_with` asserts its target exists and replaces EVERY occurrence (this module quotes its own
rules in docstrings above the lines implementing them), and every mutation test asserts the mutant's
BEHAVIOUR differs rather than merely that the suite went red.
