"""Integration tests for the sigma-scope skill (epic #902, wave 4 / #921): the five pieces
(brainstorm.py #916, dedup.py #917, compile_plan.py #918, assign.py #919, scope.py #920) wired
together the way `skills/sigma-scope/SKILL.md` actually drives them, end to end. Each piece already
has its own isolation suite (test_brainstorm.py, test_dedup.py, test_compile_plan.py, test_assign.py,
test_scope.py) — this file's job is the composition those suites don't cover: does the REAL output
of one module feed correctly into the next REAL module, all the way from a raw invocation string to
real goal files on disk plus a real wave schedule, with nothing hand-typed in the middle to paper
over a shape mismatch.

Hermetic throughout, matching every sibling test in this family: `discovery.source: local-goals`
(no `gh`, no network — the same scratch-project pattern #920's own validation run used, and the one
issue #921's addendum requires for anything that reaches `compile_plan`/`assign.execute`). No
FakeSource stands in for `compile_plan.compile_plan()`/`assign.execute()` themselves anywhere in
this file — the real `LocalSource` (via `sources.get_source`) is what actually runs, so a genuine
shape mismatch between modules would fail here even though it can't fail in either module's own
isolated suite (which mocks the other side).
