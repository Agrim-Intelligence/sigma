"""The public `.gitignore` is pinned in BOTH directions (#2739, Q1-G11).

The snapshot builder ships `public-overrides/.gitignore` as the public tree's root `.gitignore`.
That file excludes `.sdlc/*` and then re-includes the tracked design, changelog-fragment, plan and
research directories -- and re-excludes the runtime subtrees under plans. Git cannot re-include
under an excluded parent, so a single dropped or reordered line silently flips a whole tracked
directory to ignored (or a runtime tree to tracked). These tests ask git itself, with
`check-ignore`, rather than grepping for lines: the file's meaning, not its text, is what ships.

FILE UNDER TEST, by tree (the `public_surface` convention -- `tools/public-manifest.txt` present
means the monorepo): monorepo -> `public-overrides/.gitignore`, NEVER the private root
`.gitignore`, which would silently test the wrong file; public tree -> the root `.gitignore`, which
is where the override lands. Absence in either is a defect (the override is tracked and the builder
refuses a snapshot without it), so there is no skip case, and the node ids and outcomes are
identical in both trees, as the snapshot's collection-equality check requires.

HARNESS: a fresh `git init` under `tmp_path` holding the text as its `.gitignore`, with every
other ignore source neutralised -- `.git/info/exclude` blanked, `-c core.excludesFile=` passed
(measured: `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null` alone does NOT disable the default
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore`), and HOME/XDG pointed at scratch. A global `*.md` ignore can only
fake a RED on the not-ignored direction, never a green, but the test must not depend on the host.

Both directions occur, so neither assertion can be vacuous, and an in-test control (drop
`!.sdlc/plans/`) shows the harness going red. Stdlib and pytest only; module-level tests only.
S2-G3 (#2589) deletes monorepo mode; the manifest branch of `_override_path` dies with it.
