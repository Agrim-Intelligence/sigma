"""`sigma-define` end to end (#1662): open a unit, then fill it with work that BELONGS to it.

The unit suite (`tests/test_define.py`) proves each half against fakes. This file's job is the
composition those cannot cover, and it is the whole point of the skill: **does the real output of
`open_unit` -> `stamp_plan` -> the real `compile_plan.compile_plan()` -> `declare` produce issues
that `features.read` -- the SAME reader the pick path runs -- reads back as declaring the unit?**

If it does not, every issue the skill files is one Sigma either bases on the wrong branch or
refuses outright, and no unit test anywhere would say so: §4a is silent by design, so a marker that
lands somewhere rule 5 refuses to read produces no error at all.

TWO THINGS MAKE THIS A REAL MEASUREMENT RATHER THAN A RESTATEMENT.

  - THE ISSUES ARE FILED BY THE REAL `compile_plan.compile_plan()` AGAINST THE REAL `LocalSource`,
    the same hermetic `discovery.source: local-goals` pattern `test_sdlc_scope_integration.py` uses
    and for the same reason: no FakeSource stands in for the module actually under composition, so a
    shape mismatch between the stamp and the filer fails HERE even though neither module's own suite
    can fail on it. The bodies read back are read off disk, from the files `create_dependency` wrote.
  - THE LABEL USED AT VERIFICATION IS THE ONE THE FLOW CREATED, NEVER ONE THIS FILE TYPED. The fake
    `gh` holds a real label set; `open_unit`'s label step writes into it; `attach_label` refuses any
    name that set does not hold, exactly as `GitHubSource._swap_labels` raises rather than minting.
    So a flow that skipped step 4 comes back `body_only` and
    `test_the_flow_is_non_vacuous_the_label_half_really_is_load_bearing` proves that is what happens.

`LocalSource` deliberately does not define the label surface -- there is no label index over goal
FILES -- so `LabelledLocalSource` below adds exactly the two methods `declare` duck-types on and
delegates everything else to the real object. That is the narrowest possible stand-in: every method
`compile_plan` touches is the real one.
