# --------------------------------------------------- watch_daemon.py: #1227 PID-reuse liveness bug
# The guard above is PID-existence-plus-freshness, not PID-existence alone (see watch_daemon.py's own
# #1227 header comment for the full mechanism). These prove the actual filed bug: a dead watcher's
# pid, silently reused by an unrelated live process, must now be detected as dead rather than
# wedging the watcher forever. We cannot force genuine kernel pid-reuse deterministically, but
# `kill -0` cannot itself tell "the kernel reused this number" apart from "any other live process
# happens to sit at this number" -- both make `kill -0` succeed identically, so this test process's
# own pid (os.getpid(), guaranteed alive for the whole test, definitely not the watcher) is an
# exact behavioral stand-in for the bug, same technique the (now-updated) test above already relied
# on for the inverse case.

# ------------------------------------- watch_daemon.py: genuine concurrent-start race (F21/#339)
# The four tests above are all SEQUENTIAL, single-invocation checks -- exactly the shape F21 found a
# gap behind: a `kill -0` check followed by a SEPARATE pidfile write has a window for two truly
# simultaneous starts to both pass the check before either writes. These tests instead launch REAL,
# concurrently-running `watch_daemon.py` subprocesses (Popen, not run -- so they overlap in wall-clock
# time, not one-after-another) and assert on the actual outcome, mirroring the discipline used for
# loop.py's flock-based claim lock (F10.5-2/#387).
#
# The property F21 actually cares about is not "exactly one process EVENTUALLY reports success" --
# it's "at no point in time are two watchers simultaneously alive contending on the ledger's git
# index lock". An earlier version of this test made every winner exit almost instantly (a pre-set
# stop-file), which turned out to be a REAL source of false positives, not just a theoretical one:
# at high racer counts, a winner can finish and clean up SO fast that an already-queued racer gets a
# second, fully sequential, entirely harmless turn afterward -- a legitimate hand-off, not a race,
# but indistinguishable from one by a bare "how many eventually said they won" count. Confirmed
# empirically: the fast-exit trick showed exactly this at both 25 and 40 racers on repeated runs,
# while forcing the winner to stay genuinely alive for a real few seconds -- removing all ambiguity
# -- showed 0 anomalies at the same racer counts (both via a native bash `for ... & wait` loop; a
# pytest/Popen-launched race has more inherent process-launch stagger, and needs meaningfully higher
# racer counts to reproduce the SAME race reliably -- see below).
#
# So every test here uses a genuine multi-second sleep (SIGMA_WATCH_INTERVAL, no SLEEP_SCALE=0
# shortcut) for the winner instead of an instant stop-file exit, and asserts on which processes are
# STILL ALIVE partway through, not just on the eventual message tally.
#
# Honest scope note: three real bugs were found across this fix's development and its own
# independent review -- an mv-based eviction scheme that let a delayed racer's mv clobber an
# already-fresh winner (caught directly by an EARLIER, stop-file-based version of the tests below,
# in this same pytest suite, at 6-8 racers); a `stat`-failure fallback that made "the mutex was
# already legitimately released" indistinguishable from "infinitely stale", letting multiple losers
# reclaim an already-free mutex at once (found via a native bash 40-racer loop; deliberately
# re-verified non-vacuous against a scratch reproduction of that exact line before shipping the fix,
# but NOT reliably reproduced by this file's own pytest/Popen-launched races, which appear too
# loosely staggered to hit that specific razor-thin real-time window at a racer count still cheap
# enough to ship); and a plain, unguarded stat+age-check+rmdir+mkdir RECLAIM sequence that let
# several racers who all read the SAME stale mtime race that four-step sequence against each other
# -- the identical shape as the pidfile bug, one level up in the mutex meant to prevent it. That
# third one was found by independent review, not self-discovered -- and unlike the second, it IS
# reliably reproduced by this file's own pytest/Popen-launched races (confirmed: 70-90% anomaly
# rate at 15/40/80 racers against the unfixed code, 0/10 at all three after the fix, same harness
# both directions), because its trigger condition is a wide, deliberately-planted stale window
# (tens of seconds) rather than a razor-thin natural one -- Python's larger process-launch stagger
# doesn't matter when the window it needs to land in is that wide.
#
# The FINAL design's correctness rests on BOTH this file's suite (which passes consistently, dozens
# of runs, no flakes observed, and for two of the three bugs is independently sufficient on its own)
# AND substantially more extensive native-bash verification done during development and re-review
# (100+ runs across 8/25/40-racer configurations, 0 anomalies) for the one bug this suite alone
# cannot reliably catch. The tests below are a genuine, real-process regression check for this
# property, not a purely theoretical one, but they are not claimed to be maximally sensitive to
# every conceivable future regression in this area.

def test_watch_daemon_run_rotates_an_oversized_log_end_to_end(tmp_path):
    """The documented gesture (`watch_daemon.py <sdlc>`) against a real two-tick run, with the cap
    the config sets (1024) and a 4 KB sentinel prefill. Exactly ONE roll: tick #1 rolls the prefill
    into `.1` and then writes into the fresh file; tick #2 finds it under cap and appends.

    ARITHMETIC (measured 2026-09-28 in a tmp sdlc on this host, before trusting the test): one idle
    tick is ~174 B (`watch: tick #N — <date>` + `pulled` + `nothing to publish` + the sub-calls'
    stderr in a repo with no ledger worktree); the whole two-tick run incl. the tee'd
    `max ticks (2) reached` line is 389 B -- well under 1024, so tick #2 cannot roll. The
    assertions key on WHERE the sentinel and `tick #1` land, not on sizes (R-1): a rotation that ran
    after the tick line would put `tick #1` in `.1` (C-2), and no rotation leaves the sentinel in
    `watch.log` (C-1)."""
