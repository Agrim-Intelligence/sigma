"""#2660 — the mandatory control: "where core's goals live after publication" (board, labels,
`.sdlc/config.json`, and the routing rule) proven end to end against a scratch repository that
carries none of this project's own vocabulary.

WHAT THIS DRIVES. A real `/sigma-init`, the public-repository adoption block from
`skills/sigma-setup/references/public-repo.md` (Task 2) run EXACTLY as the doc prints it, and then
the documented `sigma-loop` cycle (`loop.py start` -> `next` -> `agent-start` -> `work.py start` ->
`phase_report.py` -> `work.py commit/pr/merge` -> `loop.py record done` (REFUSED while the PR is
open, #232) -> `loop.py record review` -> the human's `pr merge` -> `loop.py reconcile-merges`,
which records `done`, closes the issue and releases the checkout) against a stateful, PATH-installed fake `gh` and a real bare git remote. Every gh
CLI call the shipped scripts make is modelled by the fake; a call the fake does not recognise exits
1, is written to `FAKE_GH_UNHANDLED`, and every test that runs the fixture asserts that log is
empty (M9 below is exactly why: a call the product's own fail-open code swallows can leave the
cycle green while quietly not testing what it looks like it tests).

THE FAKE'S OWN JQ. `--jq` is implemented by the fake itself, in Python, against its own JSON — never
by shelling out to `/usr/bin/jq` (see `_JQ_EXPRS`). It supports only the small closed set the
shipped CLIs actually pass. A missing key or an explicit `null` renders as an EMPTY LINE, matching
real `gh`'s template rendering (confirmed against `work.py:2041-2042`'s own `if not number:` -- that
check depends on an empty string, not the four characters `null`, to detect "no existing PR yet").

MEASURED FACTS (recorded once at implementation time, this repo's own Mac, in the fashion §4 of the
plan already established):

  M-impl-1 (test 1, red before Task 2): before `skills/sigma-setup/references/public-repo.md`
    existed, this test's own `read_text()` raised `FileNotFoundError`. Green once the doc was
    written.
  M-impl-2 (test 3, the self-heal mutation -- §4 M3/M16's own corrected order): with `_ensure_labels`
    replaced by `return` for the REFILL call only, and the second-clone probe run AFTER the refill
    (never before it), the three assertions the plan names went red: `sdlc:in-progress` did not
    exist in the fake's label set again, issue 2 did not carry it, and `CLAIM-LABEL-WRITE-FAILED #2`
    appeared on stderr. The other three assertions ("issue 1 lost the label at deletion", "the
    refill printed `2`", "goal 1 still reached `MERGED`") stayed green, exactly as measured in the
    plan's own §4 M16. Restoring `_ensure_labels` returned all six to green.
  M-impl-3 (test 6, the loud-not-silent refusal): with the fake's `refuse_label_create` UNSET, the
    `CLAIM-LABEL-WRITE-FAILED #1` marker assertion went red (the claim landed silently instead).
    Restoring the refusal returned it to green.
  M-impl-4 (test 7, the no-labels refusal): with the `labels` line kept in the doc block, the human's
    filing succeeded and this test's own refusal assertion went red (no refusal to observe). Removing
    it (the test's own gesture) is what makes it green.
  M-impl-5 (test 9, the `_apply_default` mutant, §4 M14's own corrected control): with the
    `if d.get(key) is None:` guard in `setup.py::_apply_default` removed (so it writes
    unconditionally), a SECOND `configure` call after the profile turned `ledger.enabled` back to
    `true`. Restoring the guard returned it to `false`.
  M-impl-6 (test 10, the fake's own unknown-label check): with that check removed from the fake's
    `issue create`/`issue edit --add-label` handling, this test's own duplicate-label/unknown-label
    assertions went red, AND (as the plan's own §4 M13 predicts) test 7 went red too, because the
    filing it depends on no longer refuses. Both restored to green together.

RUNTIME, MEASURED (three consecutive runs, this Mac): 60.94s, 60.29s, 60.57s wall-clock for this
whole module -- a few tenths to about a second OVER the plan's own <60s target, not under it. The
primary-sequence fixture (with the second-clone probe) alone measured 28.33s, close to the plan's
own §4 M15 number (25.6s); the gap is almost entirely `_BACKLOG_READ_RETRIES`' own empty-read
backoff (F4, already a named, accepted follow-up this goal does not fix) across the module's six
`next`/`next --skip` calls, plus ordinary machine variance. Reported as measured rather than forced
to match, per RELIABILITY -- the difference is real and worth a human decision (accept the margin,
or land F4 first), not something to hide by weakening a test.

THE HARD PLAN GATE IS OFF IN THE TEMPLATE (`gates.hard_plan_gate` is unset/false in
`config.json.tmpl`), so `work.py pr`'s plan-on-branch check never fires here and no plan file is
copied into any worktree for this fixture.

NOT PROVEN HERE (stated, not silently assumed -- doc D7(3)/plan §"Task 5 test 1"): the doc's §5 (the
board -- only branch (b), an owner that already has boards, is exercised; branch (a)'s
`project create` auto-create is not modelled by the fake) and §6 (a defect in Sigma itself --
this goal's control makes no `handoff.py`/routing call at all). None of this has yet been run
against real GitHub; that is #2588's gate.
